[<em>This question addressed to</em> The Sun, <em>New York, received this reply</em>.]</p>

<p><em>We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the
communication below, expressing at the same time our great gratification
that its faithful author is numbered among the friends of</em> The Sun:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><em>Dear Editor: I am 8 years old.</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Papa says, “If you see it in</em> The Sun <em>it’s so.”</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Please tell me the truth; is there a Santa Claus?</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent30"><span class="smcap"><em>Virginia O’Hanlon.</em></span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><em>Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been afflicted by
the scepticism of a sceptical age. They do not believe except they see.
They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little
minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s, are
little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his
intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by
the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.</em></p>

<p><em>Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as
love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound
and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary
would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as
dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith
then, no poetry, no romance, to make tolerable this existence. We should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with
which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.</em></p>

<p><em>Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in
fairies. You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys
on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see
Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa
Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real
things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did
you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no
proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the
wonders that are unseen and unseeable in the world.</em></p>

<p><em>You may tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise
inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest
man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever
lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can
push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and
glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is
nothing else real and abiding.</em></p>

<p><em>No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever.
A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years
from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.</em></p>

<h2>Christmas Greens</h2>

<p>It is hard for you who have never felt the lack of heat and
light to know what the long dark winter must have meant
to the men of long ago who first kept the midwinter feast.
Many of them really believed that as the days grew shorter
and shorter, and the nights long and cold, there was danger
that the sun might go out altogether and the whole world die
in the darkness. When, late in December, the days began to
lengthen, and they saw that the sun was coming back to bring
again the flowers and the summer heat, they fancied that a
new sun had been born. So then for gladness they kept a
feast which naturally in later years was changed into a festival
in honor of the birth of Christ, “the sun of righteousness.”</p>

<p>With the feast itself some other of their old customs have
been handed down to us, and among them is that of bringing
into the house in midwinter the boughs of Christmas green.
For these far-away folk believed that wood-spirits—you know
them as brownies, fairies, and elves—were living in the forests
outside, and were so sorry to think of them shivering under
the snow-laden trees and in damp icy caves, that they used to
place in the corners of their houses great branches of hemlock
and balsam fir, that “the good little people” might creep into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the sort of shelters they loved and be warm. And as the heat
of the fire brought out the sweet smell of the fir, it seemed
to them like a “thank you” from their friends of the summer
woods. Thus they, first of all men, felt the wish to give which
is the heart of the Christmas spirit. And soon they began
to hang little gifts for their unseen guest upon the green
boughs, and to make them bright with the berries of holly
and ash. After that it may be that some night hunter, crouching
in the underbrush, looked up to the stars, and felt that
his tree was incomplete without twinkling lights. However
that may be, the custom of trimming the house with evergreens,
holly, and lights at Christmas time is an old, old one.</p>

</div>


<p>Now in the days of Herod, King of Judea, the angel
Gabriel was sent from God unto a city in Galilee named
Nazareth, unto a virgin whose name was Mary, to whom he
said: Hail, thou that art highly favored! the Lord is with
thee! blessed art thou among women! But she was greatly
troubled by his greeting and wondered what such words could
mean. Fear not, Mary! for thou hast found favor with God,
he said, and went on to tell her of the Son who should be
hers, and whom she was to call Jesus. He shall be great,
she was told, and shall be called the Son of the Most High;
and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his
father David; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob
forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass there went out a decree from Cæsar
Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled. And all went
to enroll themselves, every one to his own city. And Joseph
also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because
he was of the house of the family of David; to enroll himself
with Mary. And it came to pass, while they were there she
brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there
was no room for them in the inn.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/facing004.jpg" alt="manger">
</figure>
<br>

<p>And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in
the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. And
an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold I
bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all
the people: for there is born to you this day in the city of
David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this is the
sign unto you; ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling
clothes, and lying in a manger. And suddenly there was
with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God,
and saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Glory to God in the highest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on earth peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among men in whom he is well pleased.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when the angels went away from
them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us
now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come
to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And
they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and
the babe lying in the manger. And when they saw it they
made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them
about this child. And all that heard it wondered at the things
which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. But Mary
kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. And
the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken
unto them.</p>

<p>And when eight days were fulfilled his name was called</p>

<p class="center no-indent">JESUS.</p>

</div>


<p>Now when Jesus was born, behold, Wise men from the
east came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born
King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are
come to worship him. And when Herod the king heard it,
he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And gathering
together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he
inquired of them where the Christ should be born. And they
said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written
by the prophet: <em>And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, art in
no wise least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee
shall come forth a governor, which shall be shepherd of my
people Israel.</em> Then Herod privily called the Wise men, and
learned of them carefully what time the star appeared. And
he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out
carefully concerning the young child; and when ye have found
him, bring me word that I also may come and worship him.
And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the
star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
came and stood over where the young child was. And when
they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
And they came into the house and saw the young child with
Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him;
and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold
and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned of God in a
dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed
into their own country another way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Now when they were departed, behold an angel of the
Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take
the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be
thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young
child to destroy him. And he arose and took the young
child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt; and
was there until the death of Herod. Then Herod, when he
saw that he was mocked of the Wise men was exceeding
wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were
in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years
old and under, according to the time which he had carefully
learned of the Wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was
spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: <em>A voice was heard
in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for
her children; and she would not be comforted, because they
are not.</em></p>

<p>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise and
take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of
Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.
And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and
came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus
was reigning over Judea in the room of his father Herod,
he was afraid to go thither; and being warned of God in a
dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee, and came and
dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophets, that he should be called
a Nazarene.</p>

</div>

<p>A Dutch boy does not have to wait until December 25
for the great gift-day of the year. He is one of those who
look for the gift-bringing saint on the eve of his own day
which falls on December 6. For days beforehand the shops
have been filled with toys and gaily trimmed, and on the
evening of December 5 St. Nicholas is supposed by the little
ones to make choice of the special treasure intended for little
Dutch Jan or Martje. Indeed, it is one of the children’s
treats to go out on that night to see the shops; and in the
doorway of many of them stands a gorgeously clad likeness
of the saint.</p>

<p>At home the children in turn are visited by the saint; in
he walks carrying a big sackful of candies, oranges, apples,
and so forth, which he scatters on the floor. Indeed, the Eve
of St. Nicholas is called in Holland <em>Strooiavond</em>, which means
“strewing evening.” This idea of a strewing evening crops
up curiously often as one reads of the various customs connected
with the December holidays the world over. In
southern France the Provençal women strew wheat on the
surface of shallow dishes of water, planting St. Barbara’s
grain; in Mexico the children try to break with a long stick
a bag or jug swung high above their heads, scattering the
contents at last all over the floor.</p>

<p>In some parts of Servia there is found among the Christmas
customs one which is probably the remnant of an early
rite from which all of these “strewing evenings” come. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
that country, after the Christmas fire has been started with
due ceremonies, the mother of the family brings in a bundle
of straw which has been made ready early in the day. All the
young children arrange themselves behind her in a row. She
then starts walking slowly about the hall, and all the adjoining
rooms, throwing on the floor handfuls of straw, and at the
same time imitating the hens sounds, “Kock ... kock ...
kock;” while all the children, representing the hen’s little
chickens, merrily follow shouting, “Peeyoo! ... peeyoo! ...
peeyoo!” The floor well strewn with straw, and the little folk
in breathless heaps upon it, the oldest man of the family throws
a few walnuts in every corner of the hall. After this a large
pot, or a small wooden box, is filled with wheat and placed
a little higher than a man’s head in the east corner of the hall.
In the middle of the wheat is fixed a tall candle of yellow
wax. The father of the family then reverently lights the
candle, and, folding his arms on his breast, he prays, while all
who are present stand silently behind him, asking God to
bless the family with health and happiness, to bless the fields
with good harvests, the beehives with plenty of honey, the
sheep with many lambs, the cows with rich creamy milk, and
so on. When he finishes his prayer, he bows deeply before
the burning candle, and all those standing behind him do the
same. He then turns toward them and says, “May God
hear our prayer, and may He grant us all health!” to which
they answer, “God grant it. Amen!”</p>

<p>In Holland the very little children believe that while they
are busy gathering up the saint’s goodies, or else in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
night, he hides away the presents meant for them all over the
house. Before they go to bed they place their largest shoes—wooden
sabots, such as you see in almost every picture of
Dutch children—in the chimney place, where in the morning
they find them stuffed with fruit, nuts, and sweets. There are
no lie-a-beds in Holland on St. Nicholas’ morning. There is
a glorious game of “seek-and-find” going on in every house
where there are children. Piet takes down one of the shining
copper saucepans hanging beside the chimney place and finds
curled up inside it the many-petticoated doll which of course
he hands over to a delighted little sister, who has somewhere
discovered his box of gaily painted leaden soldiers. There are
plenty of hiding holes in an old Dutch house; thick oak
beams support the walls and roofs and make wide ledges upon
which Rupert may find a packet containing two flat silver
buttons which once belonged to his great-grandfather. He is
the oldest son, beginning to be particular about his striped
waistcoats and the tight fit of his blue or red coat. He will
be immensely proud to wear, as every other man in the old village
does, two silver buttons at the waist of his baggy trousers.
In the parts of Holland where the new fashions have not
spoiled the old, silver buttons are to the men what such coral
necklaces as Rupert’s sister wears are to the women. These
buttons are always as big as the men can afford, and sometimes
are like saucers; the little boys, even the tiniest ones,
are dressed exactly after the pattern of their fathers, but their
two flat buttons are smaller, about as large as fifty-cent pieces,
and stamped with some design, the favorite one being a ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>When all the gifts have been hunted out (down to a pair
of skates with long curved tips for a boy so little that you
would think St. Nicholas must have made a mistake if you
did not know that Dutch children learn to skate almost as early
as you learn to walk), the children are ready for the season’s
other special treat, the gingerbread cakes. Delicately spiced
gingerbread is made into many fantastic shapes, but every
one, young or old, receives a gingerbread doll. Figures of
men are given to the women folk, and of women in ruffles and
straight skirts to the men. It is interesting to see how exactly
like these gingerbread figures are in outline to those in early
Dutch paintings. The models from which they are patterned
frequently date from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="How_St_Nicholas_Came_to_Volendam">How St. Nicholas Came to Volendam</h2>
</div>


<p>One winter I was staying with my husband at the
little fishing village of Volendam, and we wished that
the little Volendamers, who are all very poor, should for
once have a splendid St. Nicholas. A French artist, who
was there at the same time, was of our opinion, and we
were equally supported by our host Spaander and his wife
and their family of blooming daughters. In the wooden
hotel there is a “coffee-room,” long and low, of really vast
proportions. In the summer-time half of it forms the drawing-room.
At the farther end of this apartment is a small
stage, with wings. On this occasion (thanks to Spaander)
the whole of it was covered in spotless white, tables were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>erected, and upon their surface were arranged about a
thousand toys and as many oranges and cakes. A white
throne was placed for St. Nicholas, whose part was taken
by the Frenchman. He wore a long white woollen robe
falling over a purple silk underdress, a cape of costly old
yellow brocade, and a gorgeous jewelled mitre, and he
was made venerable by long white hair and beard. The
dress of the black slave, whose part was taken by my
husband, was equally correct and effective—a long tight-fitting
garment of green velvet, showing a white robe
underneath; an orange silk turban was wound round the
black locks of a disguising wig and lit up his cork-black
face. So much for the preparations, completed with considerable
trouble and a great deal of amusement.</p>

<br>

<p>My husband painted a large poster, on which was set
forth a notice to all the children of Volendam that at 6.30
a boat would land upon the quay, bearing St. Nicholas
and his faithful slave laden with gifts. One may easily
imagine the joy and delight of these poor fisher-children,
into whose uneventful lives what English children call a
treat hardly ever enters. They crowded about the announcement,
and read that St. Nicholas would come
laden with gifts. Who can say what wild, beautiful hopes
filled their hearts? Before five o’clock the youngsters
began to assemble. The quay was crowded with them,
so was the narrow road leading from the quay to the
hotel. The parents also were there, quite as excited and
almost as credulous as their children. Indeed, all Volendam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
turned out to welcome the saint. Rain began to
fall; but, although it soaked their poor clothes, it seemed
to have no damping effect upon their spirits, all afire as
they were with expectation. Meanwhile, the saint and his
slave rowed out to their boat. It was now almost dark,
but in the faint light one could still distinguish the fishing-boats
which always crowd the harbor, their tall masts
and sails dimly defined against the gray sky, and their
narrow flags gently flapping in the rain. At one point
there was an opening between the boats, a glimmering
waterway, where those who were in the secret expected
the boat to appear. The time passed slowly. It was
seven o’clock; and every one was very wet. Still, all Volendam
was full of cheerful good humor.</p>

<p>At length a blaze of bright light far out on the water
revealed the saint—a venerable figure standing in the
boat, crosier in hand, evidently blessing the expectant crowd.
In a few moments the boat reached the landing-place.
With blare of trumpets, and by the light of the torches,
a procession was formed. How radiant were the faces illumined
by the flickering glow! Soon the warm, well-lighted
café was reached. The saint sat on his throne, and his good
slave rapidly distributed presents to the little ones, safely
housed from the inclement weather! Alas! they were
very wet; but, as not one of the seven hundred coughed
during the distribution, it may be concluded that the young
Volendamers do not easily take cold. Their surroundings
are so damp that they are almost amphibious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Every face beamed with happiness. The genial St.
Nicholas and his hard-worked slave; the Spaander family
all helping vigorously; the three fine, tall Volendamers,
who, in their yellow scarves of office, kept order so gently
and gaily; down to the very youngest child,—all the faces
were sweet and patient, and aglow with the pleasure either
of giving or receiving.</p>

<p>The crowd of children looked plump and healthy,
and although many garments were much patched, there
were no rags; the poorest seemed to be well cared for
and comfortable.</p>

<p>Seven hundred of them were made happy with toys
and fruit; but there was no scrambling or pushing, nothing
but happy expectation, and then still more happy satisfaction.
All too soon it was over; the last child clattered
down the long room with its precious armful.</p>

<p>Afterwards we heard from the schoolteachers and the
children’s parents that most of them believed firmly that
it was the real saint descended from heaven who had laid
his hands on their heads in benediction as they received
their presents from the black slave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Keeping_Christmas_in_the_Old_Way">Keeping Christmas in the Old Way</h2>
</div>


<p>There is an amusing account of how Christmas used
to be observed in England in the time of George II, in a
little book called “Round about our Coal Fire, or Christmas
Entertainments,” published in 1740. The author begins:——</p>

<p>“First acknowledging the sacredness of the Holy Time
of <em>Christmas</em>, I proceed to set forth the Rejoicings which
are generally made at the great Festival.</p>

<p>“You must understand, good People, that the manner of
celebrating this great Course of Holydays is vastly different
now to what it was in former days: There was once upon
a time Hospitality in the land; an <em>English</em> Gentleman at
the opening of the great Day, had all his Tenants and Neighbours
enter’d his Hall by Day-break, the strong Beer was
broach’d, and the Black Jacks went plentifully about with
Toast, Sugar, Nutmeg, and good Cheshire Cheese; the Rooms
were embower’d with Holly, Ivy, Cypress, Bays, Laurel, and
Misselto, and a bouncing <em>Christmas</em> Log in the Chimney
glowing like the cheeks of a country Milk-maid; then was
the pewter as bright as <em>Clarinda</em>, and every bit of Brass as
polished as the most refined Gentleman; the Servants were
then running here and there, with merry Hearts and jolly
Countenances; every one was busy welcoming of Guests,
and look’d as smug as new licked Puppies; the Lasses as
blithe and buxom as the maids in good Queen <em>Bess’s</em> Days,
when they eat Sir-Loins of Roast Beef for Breakfast; <em>Peg</em>
would scuttle about to make Toast for <em>John</em>, while <em>Tom</em> run
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span><em>harum scarum</em> to draw a Jug of Ale for <em>Margery</em>: Gaffer
<em>Spriggins</em> was bid thrice welcome by the ’Squire, and Gooddy
<em>Goose</em> did not fail of a smacking Buss from his Worship while
his Son and Heir did the Honours of the House: in a word,
the Spirit of Generosity ran thro’ the whole House.</p>
<br>

<p>“In these Times all the Spits were sparkling, the <em>Hackin</em>
(a great sausage) must be boiled by Day-break, or else two
young Men took the Maiden (the cook) by the Arms, and
run her round the Market-place, till she was ashamed of
her Laziness. And what was worse than this, she must not
play with the Young Fellows that Day, but stand Neuter, like
a Girl doing penance in a Winding-sheet at a Church-door.</p>

<p>“But now let us enquire a little farther, to arrive at the
Sense of the Thing; this great Festival was in former
Times kept with so much Freedom and Openess of Heart,
that every one in the Country where a Gentleman resided,
possessed at least a Day of Pleasure in the <em>Christmas</em>
Holydays; the Tables were all spread from the first to the
last, the Sir-loins of Beef, the Minc’d Pies, the Plum-Porridge,
the Capons, Turkeys, Geese, and Plum-puddings, were
all brought upon the board; and all those who had sharp
stomachs and sharp Knives eat heartily and were welcome,
which gave rise to the Proverb—</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
<em>Merry in the Hall, when Beards wag all.</em><br>
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“A merry Gentleman of my Acquaintance desires I will
insert, that the old Folks in the Days of yore kept open
House at <em>Christmas</em> out of Interest; for then, says he, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
receive the greatest part of their rent in Kind; such as
Wheat, Barley or Malt, Oxen, Calves, Sheep, Swine, Turkeys,
Capon, Geese, and such like; and they not having
Room enough to preserve their Cattle or Poultry, nor Markets
to sell off the Overplus, they were obliged to use them
in their own Houses; and by treating the People of the country,
gained credit amongst them, and riveted the Minds and
Goodwill of their Neighbours so firmly in them that no one
durst venture to oppose them. The ’Squire’s Will was done
whatever came on it; for if he happened to ask a Neighbour
what it was a Clock, they returned with a low Scrape, it was
what your Worship pleases.</p>

<p>“The Dancing and Singing of the Benchers in the great
Inns of the Court in <em>Christmas</em>, is in some sort founded
upon Interest; for they hold, as I am informed, some Priviledge
by Dancing about the Fire in the middle of their Hall,
and singing the Song of <em>Round about our Coal Fire</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“This time of the year being cold and frosty, generally
speaking, or when Jack-Frost commonly takes us by the
Nose, the Diversions are within Doors, either in Exercise
or by the Fire-side.</p>

<p>“Country-Dancing is one of the chief Exercises....</p>

<p>“Then comes Mumming or Masquerading, when the
’Squire’s Wardrobe is ransacked for Dresses of all Kinds,
and the coal-hole searched around, or corks burnt to black
the Faces of the Fair, or make Deputy-Mustaches, and every
one in the Family except the ’Squire himself must be transformed
from what they were....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Or else there is a match at <em>Blind-Man’s-Buff</em>, and then
it is lawful to set anything in the way for Folks to tumble
over....</p>

<p>“As for <em>Puss in the Corner</em>, that is a very harmless Sport,
and one may romp at it as much as one will....</p>

<p>“The next game to this is <em>Questions and Commands</em>, when
the Commander may oblige his Subject to answer any lawful
Question, and make the same obey him instantly, under
the penalty of being smutted, or paying such Forfeit as may
be laid on the Aggressor; but the Forfeits being generally
fixed at some certain Price, as a Shilling, Half a Crown, &amp;c.,
so every one knowing what to do if they should be too stubborn
to submit, making themselves easy at discretion.</p>

<p>“As for the game of <em>Hoop and Hide</em>, the Parties have the
Liberty of hiding where they will, in any part of the House;
and if they happen to be caught the Dispute ends in Kissing,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>“Most of the Diversions are Cards and Dice, but they are
seldom set on foot, unless a Lawyer is at hand, to breed some
dispute for him to decide, or at least to have some Party in.</p>

<p>“And now I come to another Entertainment frequently
used, which is of the Story-telling Order, <em>viz.</em> of Hobgoblins,
Witches, Conjurors, Ghosts, Fairies, and such like common
Disturbers.”</p>

</div>


<p>I do not know how the forty years I have been away
have dealt with “Jule-nissen,” the Christmas elf of my childhood.
He was pretty old then, gray and bent, and there were
signs that his time was nearly over. So it may be that
they have laid him away. I shall find out when I go over
there next time. When I was a boy we never sat down
to our Christmas Eve dinner until a bowl of rice and milk
had been taken up to the attic, where he lived with the marten
and its young and kept an eye upon the house—saw
that everything ran smoothly. I never met him myself, but
I know the house-cat must have done so. No doubt they
were well acquainted; for when in the morning I went in
for the bowl, there it was, quite dry and licked clean, and the
cat purring in the corner. So, being there all night, he must
have seen and likely talked with him.... The Nisse was of
the family, as you see, very much of it, and certainly not
to be classed with the cattle. Yet they were his special concern;
he kept them quiet and saw to it, when the stableman forgot,
that they were properly bedded and cleaned and fed. He
was very well known to the hands about the farm, and they
said that he looked just like a little old man, all in gray and
with a pointed red nightcap and long gray beard. He was always
civilly treated, as he surely deserved to be, but Christmas
was his great holiday, when he became part of it, indeed, and
was made much of. So, for that matter, was everything that
lived under the husbandman’s roof, or within reach of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Blowing in the Yule from the grim old tower that had
stood eight hundred years against the blasts of the North
Sea was one of the customs of the Old Town that abide,
that I know. At sun-up, while yet the people were at breakfast,
the town band climbed the many steep ladders to the
top of the tower, and up there, in fair weather or foul,—and
sometimes it blew great guns from the wintry sea,—they
played four old hymns, one to each corner of the compass,
so that no one was forgotten. They always began with
Luther’s sturdy challenge, “A Mighty Fortress is Our God,”
while down below we listened devoutly. There was something
both weird and beautiful about those far-away strains
in the early morning light of the northern winter, something
that was not of earth and that suggested to my child’s imagination
the angel’s song on far Judean hills. Even now,
after all these years, the memory of it does that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="When_Christmas_was_not_Merry">When Christmas was not Merry</h2>
</div>


<p>Christmas was not always “Merry Christmas” in old England,
for at one time a strong effort was made to do away
with the holiday entirely, after some of the older ways
of celebrating the season had become too boisterous for
decent God-fearing folk. “At this season,” says old Dr.
Stubbs, “all the wild-heads of the parish flocking together
choose them a grand captain of Mischief, whom they crown
with great solemnity and the title of Lord of Misrule, who
chooseth as many as he will to guard his noble person. Then
every one of these men he dresseth in liveries of green, of
yellow, or other light color; and as though they were not
gaudy enough, they bedeck themselves with scarves, ribbons,
laces, and jewels. This done they tie about either leg
twenty or forty bells, with rich handkerchiefs on their heads,
and sometimes laid across their shoulders and necks....
Then march this heathenish company to the church, their
pipes piping, their drums thundering, their bells jingling,
their handkerchiefs fluttering about their heads like madmen,
their hobby horses, dragoons, and other monsters skirmishing
among the throng. And in this sort they go to church
though minister be at prayer or preaching,—dancing and
singing with such a confused noise that no man can hear
his own voice.” “My Lord of Misrule’s badges” were given
to those who contributed money to pay the expense of this
wild fooling; those who refused were sometimes ducked in
the cow pond, he adds. It is admitted that these abuses were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
quite as bad as he described, and that they were among the
chief reasons why, in the seventeenth century, Cromwell tried to
put down the great old holiday. His Puritan government ordered
that the shops were to be opened, that markets were to be held,
that all the work of the world should go on as if there had
never been carols sung or chimes set ringing “on Christmas
Day in the morning.” Instead of merry chimes, people heard
a criers harsh-sounding bell and his monotonous voice
telling every one “No Christmas! No Christmas!”</p>

<p>In Scotland about the same time bakers were ordered to
stop baking Yule cakes, women were ordered to spin in open
sight on Yule day, farm laborers were told to yoke their
ploughs. In both countries the masks, or Christmas plays,
which had been so popular in the houses of rich nobles, were
absolutely forbidden; and if one were given, those who merely
looked on might be fined and the actors whipped.</p>

<p>But the people would not have their holiday taken away.
Shops might open, but few would come to buy. In Canterbury
on one Christmas Day the townspeople asked the tradesmen to
close their shops. The tradesmen feared the law’s penalties,
so refused. In the riot that followed the mob broke the shop
windows, scattered the goods, and roughly handled the shopkeepers.</p>

<p>In London even Christmas decorations were forbidden, but
when the Lord Mayor sent a man to take down some holiday
greens from one of the houses, the saucy London ’prentice-boys
swarmed out with sticks and stones and sent him flying. Then
came on horseback, fat and lordly, even the great Lord Mayor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
himself, who thought his dignity would overawe the unruly
boys. But they only laughed and shouted until his horse took
fright and ran away—and perhaps he was glad to be let off so
easily. Even where the people dared not openly fight the new
laws, they did not obey them more than they could help. Spinning-wheels
were idle because there was no flax, and ploughs
were “gone to be mended” on Christmas Day in many an
English village until after the death of Cromwell, when the
holiday came to its own again in “merrie England.”</p>

<p>The same dislike for the festival of Christmas, with its
drinking, dancing, and stage plays, came over to the New World
with the Puritans. Only a year after the landing at Plymouth
Governor Bradford called his men out to work, “on ye day
called Christmas Day,” as on other days. But certain young
men, who had just come over in the little ship <em>Fortune</em>, held
back and said it went against their consciences to work on that
day. So the governor told them that he would spare them till
they were better informed. But when he and the rest came
home at noon from their work, he found them in the street at
play openly, some pitching the bar and some at ball and such
like sports. So he went to them and took away their implements
and told them it was against <em>his</em> conscience that they
should play and others work. If they made the keeping of it
matter of devotion, he said, let them keep their houses, but
there should be no gaming or revelling in the street. Later, in
1659, a law was made that anybody found to be keeping “by
feasting, or not working, or in any other way, any such day as
Christmas Day, shall pay for every offense five shillings.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Going_Home_for_Christmas">Going Home for Christmas.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the course of a December tour in Yorkshire, I rode for a
long distance in one of the public coaches, on the day preceding
Christmas. The coach was crowded, both inside and out, with
passengers, who, by their talk, seemed principally bound to the
mansions of relations or friends to eat the Christmas dinner.
It was loaded also with hampers of game, and baskets and
boxes of delicacies; and hares hung dangling their long ears
about the coachman’s box—presents from distant friends for
the impending feast. I had three fine rosy-cheeked schoolboys
for my fellow-passengers inside, full of the buxom health and
manly spirit which I have observed in the children of this country.
They were returning home for the holidays in high glee,
and promising themselves a world of enjoyment. It was delightful
to hear the gigantic plans of pleasure of the little rogues,
and the impracticable feats they were to perform during their
six weeks’ emancipation from the abhorred thraldom of book,
birch, and pedagogue. They were full of anticipations of the
meeting with the family and household, down to the very cat
and dog; and of the joy they were to give their little sisters by
the presents with which their pockets were crammed; but the
meeting to which they seemed to look forward with the greatest
impatience was with Bantam, which I found to be a pony, and,
according to their talk, possessed of more virtues than any steed
since the days of Bucephalus. How he could trot! how he
could run! and then such leaps as he would take—there was
not a hedge in the whole country that he could not clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>They were under the particular guardianship of the coachman,
to whom, whenever an opportunity presented, they addressed
a host of questions, and pronounced him one of the
best fellows in the whole world. Indeed, I could not but
notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and importance of
the coachman, who wore his hat a little on one side, and had a
large bunch of Christmas greens stuck in the buttonhole of his
coat. He is always a personage full of mighty care and business,
but he is particularly so during this season, having so
many commissions to execute in consequence of the great interchange
of presents....</p>

<p>Perhaps the impending holiday might have given a more
than usual animation to the country, for it seemed to me as
if everybody was in good looks and good spirits. Game,
poultry, and other luxuries of the table were in brisk circulation
in the villages; the grocers’, butchers’, and fruiterers’
shops were thronged with customers. The housewives were
stirring briskly about, putting their dwellings in order; and the
glossy branches of holly, with their bright red berries, began to
appear at the windows. The scene brought to mind an old
writer’s account of Christmas preparations: “Now capons
and hens, besides turkeys, geese, and ducks, with beef and
mutton—must all die; for in twelve days a multitude of
people will not be fed with a little. Now plums and spice,
sugar and honey, square it among pies and broth. Now or
never must music be in tune, for the youth must dance and
sing to get them a heat, while the aged sit by the fire. The
country maid leaves half her market, and must be sent again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
if she forgets a pack of cards on Christmas Eve. Great is
the contention of Holly and Ivy, whether master or dame
wears the breeches. Dice and cards benefit the butler; and if
the cook do not lack wit, he will sweetly lick his fingers.”</p>

<p>I was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation by a
shout from my little travelling companions. They had been
looking out of the coach windows for the last few miles,
recognizing every tree and cottage as they approached home,
and now there was a general burst of joy—“There’s John!
and there’s old Carlo! and there’s Bantam!” cried the happy
little rogues, clapping their hands.</p>

<p>At the end of a lane there was an old sober-looking servant
in livery waiting for them; he was accompanied by a superannuated
pointer, and by the redoubtable Bantam, a little old rat
of a pony, with a shaggy mane and long rusty tail, who stood
dozing quietly by the roadside, little dreaming of the bustling
times that awaited him.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see the fondness with which the little
fellows leaped about the steady old footman, and hugged the
pointer, who wriggled his whole body for joy. But Bantam
was the great object of interest; all wanted to mount at once;
and it was with some difficulty that John arranged that they
should ride by turns, and the eldest should ride first.</p>

<p>Off they set at last; one on the pony, with the dog bounding
and barking before him, and the others holding John’s
hands; both talking at once, and overpowering him by questions
about home, and with school anecdotes. I looked after
them with a feeling in which I do not know whether pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
or melancholy predominated; for I was reminded of those
days when, like them, I had neither known care nor sorrow,
and a holiday was the summit of earthly felicity. We stopped
a few moments afterwards to water the horses, and on resuming
our route, a turn of the road brought us in sight of a neat
country-seat. I could just distinguish the forms of a lady and
two young girls in the portico, and I saw my little comrades,
with Bantam, Carlo, and old John, trooping along the carriage
road. I leaned out of the coach window, in hopes of witnessing
the happy meeting, but a grove of trees shut it from my sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Date_of_Russias_Christmastide">The Date of Russia’s Christmastide</h2>
</div>

<p>Real winter in Russia is supposed to start on the
feast of St. Nicholas of which the date, written in Russian
style, is December 6/19. The first figure gives the date
of the month as it is known in Russia and Greece, the
second the date according to the calendar in use in all
other civilized countries.</p>

<p>The calendar which was brought into use by Julius
Cæsar, and was carried all over the then known world
by the Romans, aimed to measure the year by the time
it takes the earth to move once around the sun. His
Egyptian astronomer figured that this required 365¼ days,
so the practice was begun of having three years of 365
days, followed by a leap year, to which an extra day
is given. As a matter of fact, the length of the average
year is <em>not exactly</em> 365¼ days. To be sure, that is only
11¼ seconds or so out of the way, and this may seem a
very small matter out of a whole year; but what happens
is that every 128 years or so the calendar of Julius Cæsar
or the Julian Calendar, as it is called, gets a day behind.
By the year 1582, when Gregory XIII was Pope, the calendar
was ten days slow. So Pope Gregory issued an order
that the year was to take a new start and that thereafter
three leap years out of every four centuries should be
omitted, which keeps the calendar very nearly correct.
But though Pope Gregory might decree, it did not follow
that every one would obey at once; the ignorant thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
that by the change of date they were losing ten days of
time and, of course, of wages. After some confusion all
the Roman Catholic countries obeyed. England, being
a Protestant country, ignored Pope Gregory’s commands.
But it could not so easily dismiss the knowledge of its
own astronomers that the Gregorian Calendar, as it is called,
is nearer the truth than the Julian. In 1752, therefore,
the date of the day of the year was changed by an
Act of Parliament. The day after September 3 was to
be called September 14, which it would have been if the
calendar had not been slow. And naturally the change
was also made in America, to which the new style had been
brought already by French and Spanish settlers from
Catholic countries.</p>

<p>There were always hot jealousies between the Eastern
Church, ruled from Constantinople, and the Western, ruled
from Rome. The Eastern or Greek churches refused
to change their calendar on the order of a Latin Pope,
and to this day retain the old style, the Julian dates. This
is why their Christmas follows our Twelfth Day, for by
this time their calendar is thirteen days behind the Gregorian.
But to avoid confusion the double date is very
generally in use.</p>

<p>During the time between the Day of St. Nicholas and
Christmas it seems as if half Russia streams out upon
the ice of the river Neva in St. Petersburg. All through
the summer the boats come and go, bringing food, fuel,
building materials, everything the city needs, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
interior; but the river is frozen for six months of the year,
and in those months it is used as if it were public land.
St. Petersburg is a very gay capital in winter, when the
wealthier Russian nobles have left their country estates,
and come down to exchange visits, to give balls, or go
dashing about in gay sleighs to join the sleighing or skating
contests for which a part of the frozen river is reserved.
All around the cleared spaces on the ice, merchants have
set up temporary booths; here you may buy tea and nutcakes;
there holy pictures, or ikons, pictures of all the possible
saints, some costing a few pennies, others with gold
and silver backgrounds costing many roubles, a rouble
being worth about fifty cents. On another part of the
river a great provision market is held a little before Christmas,
and the booths stretch for miles. Everything is
frozen. Countless oxen, piles of sheep and goats, pyramids
of pigs, form a frozen range of hillocks to which the butcher
comes to make his choice. With hatchet or saw he divides
the animal, ox, or pig, or it may be a bear, into sections
which his customers store in the ice-cellars which have all
been freshly filled. Thousands of workmen are engaged
during the winter in cutting and drawing the ice from
yet another part of the Neva, and on a still frosty morning
the clink of their axes against iron ice-breakers can be
heard at a long distance from the river.</p>

<p>A great ceremony of the Greek Church takes place each
year at the end of their Christmas season—the Benediction
of the Waters—in every town and village in Russia and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
down along the coasts of Greece. In St. Petersburg the
ceremony is performed by the Czar outside the Winter
Palace. A wooden temple is put up out on the ice, decorated
with gilt and paintings within, and surrounded by a
hedge of fir boughs without. A hole is made in the ice,
and to this a long procession makes its way; troops with
bright banners, gorgeously robed bishops, and priests carrying
lighted tapers and big ikons, are followed by more
soldiers, the Czar and Czarina in magnificently jewelled
robes, and after them their Court brilliant in uniforms
and beautiful fur-trimmed dresses. They have all attended
one service in the Imperial Chapel; they now have another
on the ice. The water is blessed, evil spirits flee away,
the soldiers fire a salute, and every one is sprinkled with
the now holy water. The procession returns to the city,
carrying with it great vessels of the holy water to be used
later in all the churches. Then the people who have been
looking on try to get to the hole; some draw up pailfuls
of the cold liquid; others plunge bodily into the icy water,
believing that so they will be cleansed from sin or sickness;
many have even plunged delicate babies into it, content,
if the child does not survive the shock, in the belief that
its soul is forever saved. And over every door in the great
city on that day rests the sign of the cross, lest the evil
spirit expelled from the water should enter any home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="St_Barbaras_Grain">St. Barbara’s Grain</h2>
</div>

<p>Only in the south of France, they say, is to be found the
custom of planting St. Barbara’s grain on the fourth of December.
Earthenware dishes an inch or two in depth are half
filled with water, on the surface of which wheat is scattered, or
the small, flattened seeds of the lentil, a leafy-stemmed plant
whose honey-laden blossoms will, later in the year, draw
swarms of golden bees to the fields where it is planted. The
dish is then set in the warm ashes of the fireplace, or on the
deep stone sill of a sunny window, and the grain is left to
sprout and grow so that on the table of the Christmas Eve
supper there may be this tender promise of the harvest of the
year to come—a pale, delicate young greenness in strong
contrast with the darker evergreens. The bent old <em>gran’mère</em>
by the hearth will tell you, that as the growth is thick and
sturdy or scattered and thin, so will be the later harvests of
grain, or honey.</p>

<p>The yellow daffodil, or narcissus, is a plant which first grew
in southern France, and along the Mediterranean, and it may
be that it was some early settler from Languedoc or Provence,
who introduced into Louisiana a custom common half a
century ago, that had a dim resemblance to this planting of
St. Barbara’s grain. The daffodil bulbs were planted in shallow
earthenware dishes on the eve of All Saints, and set for
three weeks in the warm dark, and later in the sun. The older
creoles foretold a fruitful year if the flower bud were well
formed by St. Barbara’s day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_Midnight_Mass_in_France">A Midnight Mass in France</h2>
</div>


<p>The great time for making gifts in France is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jour de
l’An</i>, the day of the year, our New Year’s Day, when there
is a great exchange of cards, good wishes, visits, and
presents. On Christmas Eve, everything else used to pale
before the exciting adventure of going to the church at midnight.
After church came the Grand Supper, a family gathering
from which the children were sent to bed long before
they were ready to go, comforting themselves as they
climbed the stair by asking each other, “What do you think
P’tit Noël will put in your shoe?” But they were always
too sleepy to lie awake long enough to see whose hand it
was that dropped into each little shoe under the mantelpiece
a few goodies or bits of silver coin. Sometimes one was
guiltily afraid that a black record of naughtiness deserved
the disgracing gift of a few pebbles, but then,—surely Petit
Jesus was forgiving and next year one would be very good,
yes, of a certainty, <em>most</em> good.</p>

<p>Earlier in the evening the children had been allowed to
play any game they liked, however noisy, quite up to eleven
o’clock, which was unusual enough by itself. Then began a
great bundling up in furs and mufflers before the plunge
from the warm candle-lighted room into the frosty night,
where stars shone like gold nails driven into blue-black velvet;
the frost crunched under wooden shoes; the lanterns threw
strange, wavering shadows; a dry branch fell with a sudden
crackle; far away a horse whickered and stamped just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
one was coming toward the deepest blackness of all, where
the great gray church and the tall buildings about it threw
the Grande Place into densest shadow. Nothing in that sound
should frighten one, but every child had heard the peasants
tell of this enchanted hour when animals in their stables
could talk like men; still, nothing could harm a child on
the way to mass, of course, so one plucked up courage and
sang out extra loudly in the refrain of whatever carol was
being rung on the chimes in the ivy-covered tower.</p>

<p>The old church had always seemed large, very large for
the few who worshipped in it, but now it was majestic,
reaching up toward the skies as if to gather from the
angelic choir the great waves of music that rolled down the
valley to be heard miles away. And how could one help
gasping when a gust of wind swept him suddenly into the
porch; there through the open door he was caught and
drawn forward, adoring, by the full splendor of the altar,
studded with lights, dazzling against dark walls, green with
pine and laurel.</p>

<p>At one side was the crêche, the miniature stable scene,
where the mother ever watched in wondering love the Holy
Child. Down the long nave, from the damp stone floor
which had never known the luxury of matting, great pillars
lost themselves in the blackness of the arches. But each
who entered brought his lantern and set it on the stones in
front of him; one after another the little lights like stars
came twinkling out all over the church. And each newcomer
joined in the carols sung before the mass was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>begun—old, old carols with beloved refrains which one
heard only at Christmas time.</p>
<br>

<p>The old mysteries, quaint plays in which long ago the
peasants of Southern France acted the simple stories of the
adoration of the Babe by the angels, the shepherds, and the
Wise Men, are seen no more, but it is said that until very
recently, in some of the provinces, at a certain pause in the
mass, a shepherd knocks loudly on the great church door,
the hollow sound echoing in the solemn hush. From without
is heard singing, the voices of shepherds asking to come
in. Slowly the doors swing back, the people part and the
shepherds enter, passing up the nave between a double row
of worshippers. In front are two or three boys playing
softly on simple musical instruments, one has a flute, another
a tambourine. Then begins a quaint musical dialogue
between these peasants in their long, weather-stained cloaks,
and those who stand on either side.</p>

<p>From one hand comes the question, in high treble,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
<em>Where hast thou been?</em><br>
</p>

<p>And it is echoed from the other,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
<em>What hast thou seen?</em><br>
</p>

<p>And the deep musical voices of the shepherds answer:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<em>Deep in a manger, a little child,</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent1"><em>On the dry straw, slumbered and smiled.</em>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So they move slowly, carrying a little fruit, a measure of
grain, a pair of pigeons, to where the priest stands waiting to
bless their simple gifts and lay them at the foot of the altar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Christchild_and_the_Pine_Tree">The Christchild and the Pine Tree</h2>
</div>


<p>On the Holy Night when the Christchild was born, the
earth lay very near to heaven; all the world was at peace,
and there was no noise of war to keep men on earth from
hearing the angels sing.</p>

<p>Animals and birds and trees alike were glad because of
the coming of the Holy Babe, and like the shepherds and
the Wise Men came to bring to Him their gifts. Most of
all the little pine tree beside the road longed to take something
to the Christchild.</p>

<p>The cedars, instead of pointing their branches upward in
pointed slender trees, spread their branches wide, as Cedars
of Lebanon do to this day, and bent low to shelter the
Mother and Child. But the little pine was too small to
shelter anything, and though he stretched and stretched, he
was not even tall enough to keep the sun out of the eyes
of the Wonderful Babe. He was barely tall enough for the
wind to make a whispering sound in the tips of his little
branches.</p>

<p>The thorn, although it was midwinter, suddenly blossomed
out and brought its white flowers to make a coverlet
for the Child’s cradle. And the little pine tree tried so hard
to blossom that pine-needles came out in tufts all over him,
but that was all; only the wind through his branches now
sounded like a sigh.</p>

<p>The “bird of God,” which we call the wren, flew quickly
and brought soft moss and feathers to make His cradle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
warm. “I will pull off all my needles to make a bed for
Him,” the pine tree said. But when he began to do that,
Mother Mary smiled and shook her head. “Your needles
would only prick Him, little pine,” she said. And the little
pine rocked in pain and the wind sighed through his branches.</p>

<p>The olive came and brought sweet-smelling oil, with which
to rub the Christchild’s little limbs; and the pine tree saw her
and ached so for something to give that the resin stood out
in big drops along his stem. “Oh!” he cried joyfully, “I,
too, have oil to give.” And Mother Mary’s smile was very
tender as she shook her head again and said gently, “But
your drops are sticky, and they would hurt His tender skin,
dear little pine.” So the little pine was very unhappy because
it had nothing to offer the Christchild. And year by year
as he grew taller, and remembered the Holy Night, the wind
swept through his branches with a sound that was almost a
moan; and ever since you can hear that sound from pine
trees all the world over.</p>

<p>Now for hundreds of years after, on each Christmas Eve,
the Christchild comes again, in the likeness of a poor child,
gathering fallen sticks in the forest. Up and down the hills
He goes, shivering in the icy cold, knocking at every door,
whether it is of a cabin or a castle, until He finds some one
who, remembering His lesson of love, calls Him in to find
warmth and shelter; and such a home He blesses. Some
there are who, like the pine tree, long to serve Him, and these
place a candle in the window, that if He pass along their
way, He may see it and come in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>But one night there was no door open and as He walked
wearily through the pine wood the wind shrieked through the
trees bending before Him. Then the Christchild turned aside
and crept under the low branches of a pine tree, which was
large enough now to shelter Him; and the moss lifted itself
from the snow to make a soft bed for the tired Child. And
the pine tree, drawing its branches close above Him, was so
happy that tears of joy ran down his branches and freezing,
hung in slender icicles. And as the first red rays of the sun
on Christmas morning shone upon them they glittered like
the candles on your Christmas tree, and the Christchild
opened His eyes and smiled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Christmas_Fire_in_Servia">The Christmas Fire in Servia</h2>
</div>


<p>Servia is one of the countries in which the old, old customs
have lasted longest. They began in the times when men
looked forward longingly to “the days in which the sun, having
gone far enough into the snowy plains of the winter, turns
back toward the green fields of summer.” The celebration
begins on the day before Christmas, which the older Servian
songs call “the day of the old Badnyak.” No one seems to
know who Badnyak was; but some have believed that the
fast-day was first kept in honor of the old sun-god, who was
thought of as grown weak and faint, and as giving place to
a younger. For on the next day was the feast of “the little
God,” the new sun who was to bring summer back again.
Nowadays, the name is given to logs cut for the Christmas fire.</p>

<p>Every Servian boy is up before daylight on the day before
Christmas, for he, of course, must be on hand when the
strongest young men of the family start out with a cart and
a pair of oxen to cut a young oak tree and bring it home.
Upon the chosen tree they throw a handful of wheat with the
greeting, “Happy Badnyi Day to you!” Then they begin to
cut it very carefully, timing the strokes of the axes and placing
them so that the tree shall fall directly toward the rising
sun, and at the exact moment when its red ball begins to
show at the edge of the world. If by any mischance, or a
stroke of the axe in the wrong place, the tree falls toward the
west, there will be great distress, for this is thought to mean
that very bad luck will follow the family through all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
coming year. If the tree should fall in the right direction but
catch in the branches of another, the good fortune of the
family will only be delayed for a while. The small boy’s
part is to watch very closely where the first chip falls, for it
is most important to carry home that first oak chip. The
trunk of the tree is trimmed and cut into two or three logs,
of which one is a foot or more longer than the others. They
are then dragged to the house, but are not taken inside until
sunset; in the meantime they stand in the courtyard on either
side the door. The house mother leaves her work as they are
brought home to break a flat cake of purest wheat flour upon
the longest log, while the little girls sing special songs. But
soon she goes back to her work, for there is a deal to be done
before sunset; the women are making Christmas cakes in the
shape of lambs and chickens, and most often of little pigs
with blunt-pointed noses and curly tails. For the pig belongs
to a Servian Christmas as much as turkey does to an American
Thanksgiving. Long ago the pagan Servians used to sacrifice
a pig to the sun-god on the day of the old Badnyak; and to
this day you will not find one Servian house in which “roast
pig” is not the chief dish of the Christmas dinner. While the
women bake, the men prepare the pig for the next day’s roasting.
The boy who so carefully brought home that first oak
chip put it at once into a wooden bowl, and his little sister and
he cover the chip, and fill the bowl with wheat.</p>

<p>Just at sunset the whole family gathers in the big kitchen.
The mother of the family gives a pair of woollen gloves to
one of the men—most often to the father, sometimes to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
strongest of her sons, who goes outside to bring in the Badnyak.
Tall wax candles are set on either side the open door,
and in front of it the mother stands with the wooden bowl in
her hands. As the log is brought in she throws a handful of
wheat at the bearer, who says, “Good evening, and may you
have a happy Badnyi Day.” He is answered by a chorus of
greetings from all in the room. In some parts of the country
each man present brings in a log and at each is thrown a little
wheat in sign of the wish that, in the year to come, food may
be plenty enough to throw away. A glass of red wine is then
sprinkled on the log, and the oldest and the strongest of the
family together place it on the burning fire in such a way that
the thick end of the log sticks out above the hearth for about
a foot. And sometimes you may see a prudent father smear
the end of it with honey and place on it a bowl of wheat, an
orange, and the ploughshare, that they may be so warmed by
the Christmas fire that the cattle shall be fed, the bees industrious,
and the trees and fields be fruitful, through all the year.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Day_of_the_Little_God">The Day of the Little God</h2>
</div>


<p>There is so little sleep for the Servian peasant on a
Christmas morning that very few except the old and the
babies go to bed at all on the night before “the day of the
little God,” as it is called. For one thing, the new Badnyak,
the great log on the Christmas fire, must be kept burning all
the time, and brightly. Then the all-important pig must be
set to roast early. When it is ready and laid before the fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
some one goes outside and fires off a gun or pistol; and when
the roasted pig is taken from the fire, the shooting is repeated.
From four to eight o’clock on a Christmas morning every
Servian village reëchoes as if it were celebrating the Fourth
of July with cannon crackers.</p>

<p>Just before sunrise some young girl of the family goes
to the fountain, or the brook from which they usually get
their drinking water. Before she fills her pots or jars she
greets the water, wishing it a happy Christmas, and throws
into it a handful of wheat. The first cupfuls of water drawn
are put into a special jar and are used to make the “Chesnitza,”
the Christmas cake, which is to be divided into a piece
for each member of the family, present or absent. A small
silver coin baked into it is supposed to fall to the lot of that
member of the family who is to meet with special good fortune
during the coming year.</p>

<br>

<p>No other visitor is allowed to enter the house before the
“Polaznik,” the Christmas guest, has come. The part is
usually taken by some boy from a neighbor’s family, who
comes very early and brings with him a woollen glove full
of wheat. When at his knock the door is opened, he showers
the wheat over those around the brightly burning fire and into
all corners of the room with the greeting, “Christ is born.”
The mother of the family throws a handful of wheat at him
and all the others shout, “In truth, He is born!” The guest
then walks straight to the fire, and with the heavy shovel
strikes the burning log with all his force repeatedly, so that
thousands of sparks rise high in the chimney, while he says,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>“May you have this year so many oxen, so many horses, so
many sheep, so many pigs, so many beehives of honey, so
much good luck, so much success and happiness.” After this
good wish he kisses his host, drops to his knees before the
Christmas log on the fire, kisses one end of it, which sticks
out of the fireplace into the room, and places a coin upon it
as his gift. As he rises, a woman offers him a low wooden
chair, but just as he seats himself draws it away so that he
sits down hard upon the ground, and is thus supposed to fix
to it firmly every good wish he has spoken. Finally he is
wrapped in a thick blanket, and with it around him sits
quietly for a few minutes while the young folks who are to
tend the flocks and herds in the coming year come to the
hearth and kiss each other solemnly across the Christmas log.
The wearing of the blanket is said to insure thick cream in
the next year, and the shepherds’ kisses will make for peace
and plenty among the cattle.</p>

<p>Before the chief meal of the day, all the members of the
family gather about its head, each with a lighted candle in
hand, while he prays briefly. Then they turn and kiss each
other with such greetings as: “Peace of God be with us!”
“Christos is born!” “In truth, He is born!” “Therefore
let us bow before Christos and His birth.” And toward the
end of the meal all stand to drink “to the glory of God and
of the birth of Christ,” which marks the end of the Christmas
celebration.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Nature_Folk-lore_of_Christmastide">Nature Folk-lore of Christmastide</h2>
</div>

<p>Among all the older peoples of Europe there are many bits
of folk stories which tell of the wonderful peace which fell upon
the world on the night of the Holy Eve. A Bosnian legend
says that at the time of the birth of Christ “the sun in the east
bowed down, the stars stood still, the mountains and the forests
shook and touched the earth with their summits, and the green
pine tree bent, ... the grass was beflowered with opening blossoms,
incense sweet as myrrh pervaded upland and forest, birds
sang on the mountain top, and all gave thanks to the great
God.” This belief in the holy and gracious kinship of all
nature at this season finds expression in many countries in an
added tenderness for all living things during Yuletide. The
very sparrows, whose nests the boys are free to raid at any other
time, have a sheaf of rye set up for their Christmas feast, says
Mr. Riis, who tells that once, stranded in a Michigan town, he
was wandering about the streets and came upon such a sheaf
raised upon a pole in a dooryard. “I knew at once,” he says,
“that one of my people lived in that house and kept Yule in
the old way. So I felt as if I were not quite a stranger.”</p>

<p>In England, robins are the birds of Christmas time; an
old legend has it that on the day of Christ’s suffering the robin
fluttered beside Him, and in trying to pluck thorns from His
crown stained its breast crimson.</p>

<p>The Spanish show special kindness at this time to any ass or
cow, believing that on Holy Night they breathed upon the
Christchild to keep Him warm. Many other quaint old beliefs
used to be common about how the animals act at Christmas
time. From northern Canada comes the Indian saying that on
the Holy Night the deer all kneel and look up to the Great
Spirit, but that whoever spies upon them will have stiffness in
his knees for all the year to come. In the German Alps it was
believed that animals have the gift of speech on Christmas
Eve, but that he who listens will surely hear them foretell some
evil for the listener. Of a like belief Mr. Riis says that, when
he was a boy:—</p>

<p>“All the animals knew perfectly well that the holiday
had come, and kept it in their way. The watch-dog was
unchained. In the midnight hour on the Holy Eve the
cattle stood up in their stalls and bowed out of respect and
reverence for Him who was laid in a manger when there
was no room in the inn, and in that hour speech was given
them, and they talked together. Claus, our neighbor’s man,
had seen and heard it, and every Christmas Eve I meant
fully to go and be there when it happened; but always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
long before that I had been led away to bed, a very sleepy
boy, with all my toys hugged tight, and when I woke up
the daylight shone through the frosted window-panes, and
they were blowing good morning from the church tower;
it would be a whole year before another Christmas. So I
vowed, with a sigh at having neglected a really sacred
observance, that I would be there sure on the next Christmas
Eve. But it was always so, every year, and perhaps it
was just as well, for Claus said that it might go ill with
the one who listened, if the cows found him out.”</p>

<p>In the older parts of Montenegro, the head of the family
and his shepherd boy still follow the quaint old custom
of lighting the animals to their stalls on Christmas Eve.
Each takes a lighted wax candle and they go together into
every stall in turn, holding the candles for a moment in
each of its corners. Then, at the stable door they take
stand, one at each side of it, and hold their candles high
while the little shepherdess drives the animals in. One by
one, sheep, goats, and oxen, they pass between the flickering
lights. After that, the shepherd boy and the little
shepherdess kiss each other “that the cattle may live in
peace and love,” they say.</p>

</div>


<p>Against the wing-wall of the Hacienda del Mayo, which
occupied one end of the plaza, was raised a platform, on which
stood a table covered with a scarlet cloth. A rude bower of
cane leaves on one end of the platform represented the manger
of Bethlehem, while a cord stretched from its top across
the plaza to a hole in the front of the church bore a large tinsel
star, suspended by a hole in its centre. There was quite a
crowd in the plaza, and very soon a procession appeared, coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
up from the lower part of the village. The three kings
took the lead; the Virgin, mounted on an ass that gloried in a
gilded saddle and rose-besprinkled mane and tail, followed them,
led by the angel; and several women, with curious masks of
paper, brought up the rear. Two characters, of the harlequin
sort—one with a dog’s head on his shoulders, and the other a
bald-headed friar, with a huge hat hanging on his back—played
all sorts of antics for the diversion of the crowd. After making
the circuit of the plaza, the Virgin was taken to the platform,
and entered the manger. King Herod took his seat at the scarlet
table, with an attendant in blue coat and red sash, whom I
took to be his Prime Minister. The three kings remained on
their horses in front of the church; between them and the platform,
under the string on which the star was to slide, walked two
men in long white robes and blue hoods, with parchment folios
in their hands. These were the Wise Men of the East, as one
might readily know from their solemn air, and the mysterious
glances which they cast toward all quarters of the heavens.</p>

<p>In a little while, a company of women on the platform,
concealed behind a curtain, sang an angelic chorus to the tune
of “Opescator dell’ onda.” At the proper moment, the Magi
turned toward the platform, following the star, to which a
string was conveniently attached that it might be slid along the
line. The three kings followed the star till it reached the
manger, when they dismounted, and inquired for the sovereign,
whom it had led them to visit. They were invited upon the
platform and introduced to Herod, as the only king; this did not
seem to satisfy them, and, after some conversation, they retired.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
By this time the star had receded to the other end of the line
and commenced moving again, they following. The angel
called them into the manger, where, upon their knees, they were
shown a small wooden box, supposed to contain the sacred infant:
they then retired, and the star brought them back no
more. After this departure, King Herod declared himself
greatly confused by what he had witnessed, and was very much
afraid this newly found king would weaken his power. Upon
consultation with his Prime Minister, the Massacre of the Innocents
was decided upon, as the only means of security.</p>

<p>The angel, on hearing this, gave warning to the Virgin,
who quickly got down from the platform, mounted her bespangled
donkey, and hurried off. Herod’s Prime Minister directed
all the children to be handed up for execution. A boy,
in ragged sarape, was caught and thrust forward; the Minister
took him by the heels in spite of his kicking, and held his head
on the table. The little brother and sister of the boy, thinking he
was really to be decapitated, yelled at the top of their voices, in
an agony of terror, which threw the crowd into a roar of laughter.
King Herod brought down his sword with a whack on the
table, and the Prime Minister, dipping his brush into a pot of
white paint which stood before him, made a flaring cross on
the boy’s face. Several other boys were caught and served
likewise; and finally, the two harlequins, whose kicks and
struggles nearly shook down the platform. The procession
then went off up the hill, followed by the whole population of
the village.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Breaking_the_Pinate">Breaking the Piñate</h2>
</div>

<p>If you were in Mexico the week before Christmas you
would not find one Christmas tree, unless it were in some town
where Americans have been living for a good while. But
everywhere children would be talking about breaking a piñate
(pronounced pin-yah-tay) as you talk of having a tree. In the
small stalls set up in the plazas for the sale of Christmas gifts
there are hundreds of different gayly colored piñates. Some
are bowl-shaped or oval jars made out of the coarse red earthenware
of Puebla, painted with dashes of yellow and black in patterns
that have been copied from old Indian pottery. Others
are made of paper in gay stripes of red and yellow, in shape
like tissue-paper balloons, and are decorated with tinsel ornaments
and streamers of bright-colored paper, such as are hung
on Christmas trees. Others still are made in the shape of grotesque
figures, clowns with baggy trousers, dancing girls in
wide-spread skirts, monks in long cloaks, and animals. All of
them, jars or paper figures, are easily breakable; they are
stuffed with sweets, crackers, rattles, whistles, or any other toys
which are small and light, and parents hang them—usually on
Christmas Eve—from the ceiling of a room or from a branch
of a tree in the courtyard. Each child of the family in turn
after being blindfolded, given a long stick, and led some distance
away from the hanging piñate, is allowed to grope toward where
he thinks it is and to strike out at it three times in the effort
to break it. If he fails, another is given the chance. Mexican
families are large and often a father and all his sons live together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
in square, flat-roofed buildings of sun-dried brick around
a common courtyard. So there is a deal of laughter and excitement
as one child after another makes his trial. At last one
manages to hit the piñate so that it breaks open and toys, sweets,
and ornaments come down in a shower. This is the moment
for which the children crowding around have been waiting, and
they swoop down upon the dainties in a joyous scramble. The
successful child usually receives a special prize; for, blindfolded
as he is, he stands small chance of getting anything else.</p>

<p>Breaking the piñate usually follows a curious ceremony in
which all those present walk together around the house several
times chanting a litany. The procession is in memory of the
night when Joseph and Mary journeyed to Bethlehem and
found no room in the inn. Often even the donkey belonging
to the family is brought into the ceremony. After the litany
some go within the house while others outside sing a plea for
admittance, which is at first roughly refused. Finally they are
admitted, and another hymn is followed by feasting and merry-making,
of which breaking the piñate is the children’s part.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Christmas_upon_a_Greenland_Iceberg">Christmas upon a Greenland Iceberg</h2>
</div>


<p>One hot June day in 1869 there was a great stir in the
new harbor of Bremerhaven in Germany; at its entrance
lay two stout ships, the <em>Germania</em> and the <em>Hansa</em>, fully
fitted out for Arctic exploration. Visitors and messengers
were going back and forth. The King of Prussia himself,
with many of his nobles, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg,
Schwerin, Count Bismarck, and General von Moltke among
them, had come from Berlin to say Godspeed to the commander
and the scientific gentlemen who were braving
unknown dangers, and certain privations and hardships “for
the honor of the German navy and of German science,” as
his Majesty expressed it.</p>

<p>The last of the cases of stores hoisted on board the
<em>Hansa</em> were stowed away with a peculiar laughing tenderness.
They were stout chests cased in lead in which friends
of these explorers had placed such friendly little trifles as
are inseparable from the celebration of Christmas wherever
the Germans may be.</p>

<p>There is no place in this book for the story of their
adventures in the slow voyage up beyond the ice line. In
July, by some misunderstanding of signals, the two ships
separated, never to meet again. In September the <em>Hansa</em>
was caught in a great field of floating ice and was carried
for two hundred days thereafter in the drift of the floe. An
October storm so racked the ship that her captain and crew
were forced to abandon her and carry everything out upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the ice. The great coal-bin of the ship was taken out and
turned into a store hut. All the supplies were taken there,
the ship’s three boats were carefully secured, everything was
taken from the <em>Hansa</em> which could be used for fuel, and at
last the ship was cut away from the ice lest in sinking she
destroy them.</p>

<p>Then began a frightful period of drifting. Storm after
storm put them in danger of a sudden death which may
have seemed more desirable than waiting for the winds and
currents to carry them slowly into a warmer sea and toward
the natural breaking up of the ice-floe. Hope of rescue in
those lonely waters was faint.</p>

<p>But they lived bravely and worked steadily, constructing
around the main hut, from the timbers saved from the
<em>Hansa</em>, small black shelters in which, all but buried in the
snow, the men lived. And that they kept Christmas in
true German fashion the log of the vessel tells:—</p>

<p>“The tree was erected in the afternoon, while the greater
part of the crew took a walk; and the lonely hut shone with
wonderful brightness amid the snow. Christmas upon a
Greenland iceberg! The tree was artistically put together of
firwood and ravelled matweed [hemp?], and Dr. Laube had
saved a twist of wax taper for the illumination. Chains of
colored paper and newly baked cakes were not wanting, and the
men had made a knapsack and a revolver case as a present for
the captain. We opened the leaden chests of presents from
Professor Hochstetter and the Geological Society, and were
much amused by their contents. Each man had a glass of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>port wine; and we then turned over the old newspapers which
we found in the chests, and drew lots for the presents, which
consisted of small musical instruments, such as fifes, jews’-harps,
trumpets, etc., with draughts and other games, puppets,
crackers, etc. In the evening we feasted on chocolate and
gingerbread.”</p>

<br>

<p>“We observed the day very quietly,” wrote Dr. Laube in
his diary. “If this Christmas be the last we are to see, it was
at least a cheerful one; but should a happy return home be
decreed for us, the next will, we trust, be a far brighter. May
God so grant!”</p>

<p>And He did. But that is not a Christmas story, and you
will have to look elsewhere for it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Good_Night_in_Spain">The Good Night in Spain</h2>
</div>

<p>If you were a child in Spain, you would not be talking of
Christmas trees in the late December days, but of <em>navidades</em>,
or “nativities.” These are tiny models of a scene supposed
to be Bethlehem. Some of them are very simple, made of
cardboard, colored paper, bits of stone and sand. On one
side is a hill, built up of paper or plaster, and in the side of
it is the cave to which the gentle cattle were used to come
for food and shelter. By its crude match-wood manger stand
or sit little figures of the Holy Family. Often these are modelled
from beautiful designs, the work of famous artists who
put their highest skill into creating the tiny images of the
mother and the Holy Child. Outside the cave stand the
patient oxen, and perhaps the donkey upon which the Infant
Christ is to be carried out of the reach of Herod. Overhead
sparkles a shining star. Some of these simple “nativities”
can be bought for a few cents. Others made of better materials,
or with greater care, and with many figures, are more
costly. These have, besides the Holy Family, perhaps, a fire
of ruddy tinfoil around which shepherds gather, looking, in
their straight brown cloaks, as if they might have stepped from
your Noah’s ark, and back of them, on a hillside of green cloth,
little white wool lambs feed quietly. In still another you may
even see a smuggler with a slouch hat pulled down over his
eyes, hiding with a load of tobacco behind a paper rock to
leave the road free for the Three Kings who in all their tinsel
go journeying to worship the Holy Child. The roads are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
rough with bits of cork, the river is a strip of glass, and the
bridge over which the camels of the Wise Men pass is clearly
of paper stone; the rabbit hiding in the evergreens is quite as
large as the donkey saddled for the flight into Egypt; but in
the magic of “the Holy Night” all seem to be real, to live and
feel, so natural and tender is the children’s faith in these simple
“nativities,” which are repeated on a larger scale in all the
churches.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, or the Good Night, as the Spanish
children say, every one must go to the church for the midnight
mass, and of course no one goes to bed before that. Early in
the dusk the toy dealers bring their booths and flaming naphtha
torches to the village plaza, and the children swarm around
them like flies to sweets. All the week before groups of these
children have been going from door to door at night singing
to familiar tunes ballads which tell the story of the Nativity,
and he is a poor Spaniard who cannot find some small coins
for the band of singers. On Holy Night, too, after they have
made the small round of the toy-dealers’ stands, they go to
each other’s houses to look at the different nativities and sing
one carol after another in which a single voice carries a verse,
remembered or made up at the time, and the others join in the
refrain while two of them dance. At the end of each verse the
two whose turn it has been to dance go up to the nativity
with flushed cheeks and bright eyes, open wide their little
arms and fall on their knees, with the exclamation “For Thee.”
In some places the children will instead carry a nativity into
the plaza, singing carols in which every one joins.</p>

</div>


<p>It was a huge Christmas tree, the first that had ever grown
in our compound,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the children of our servants and writers
and employees, who make up the number of our Legation
population to close on two hundred. I could not have the tree
on Christmas Day, owing to various engagements; so it was
fixed for January 3, and was quite the most successful entertainment
I ever gave!</p>

<p>When I undertook it, I confess that I had no idea how many
little ones belonged to the compound. I sent our good Ogita
round to invite them all solemnly to come to Ichiban (Number
One) on the 3d at five o’clock. Ogita threw himself into the
business with delighted good-will, having five little people of
his own to include in the invitation; but all the servants were
eager to help as soon as they knew we were preparing a treat
for the children. That is work which would always appeal to
Japanese of any age or class. No trouble is too great, if it
brings pleasure to the “treasure flowers,” as the babies are
called. Some of them were not little, and these were more
difficult to buy presents for; but after many cold hours passed
in the different bazaars, it seemed to me that there must be
something for everybody, although we had really spent very
little money.</p>

<p>The wares were so quaint and pretty that it was a pleasure
to sort and handle them. There were work-boxes in beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
polished woods, with drawers fitting so perfectly that when you
closed one the compressed air at once shot out another. There
were mirrors enclosed in charming embroidered cases; for
where mirrors are mostly made of metal, people learn not to
let them get scratched. There were dollies of every size, and
dolls’ houses and furniture, kitchens, farmyards, rice-pounding
machines—all made in the tiniest proportions, such as it seemed
no human fingers could really have handled. For the elder
boys we bought books, school-boxes with every school requisite
contained in a square the size of one’s hand, and penknives and
scissors, which are greatly prized as being of foreign manufacture.
For decorations we had an abundant choice of materials.
I got forests of willow branches decorated with artificial fruits;
pink and white balls made of rice paste, which are threaded on
the twigs; surprise shells of the same paste, two lightly stuck
together in the form of a double scallop shell, and full of miniature
toys; <em>kanzashi</em>, or ornamental hairpins for the girls, made
flowers of gold and silver among my dark pine branches; and
I wasted precious minutes in opening and shutting these dainty
roses—buds until you press a spring, when they open suddenly
into a full-blown rose. But the most beautiful things on my
tree were the icicles, which hung in scores from its sombre foliage,
catching rosy gleams of light from our lamps as we worked
late into the night. These were—chopsticks, long glass chopsticks,
which I discovered in the bazaar; and I am sure Santa
Klaus himself could not have told them from icicles. Of course
every present must be labelled with a child’s name, and here
my troubles began. Ogita was told to make out a correct list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
of names and ages, with some reference to the calling of the
parents; for even here rank and precedence must be observed,
or terrible heart-burnings might follow. The list came at last,
and if it were not so long, I would send it to you complete, for
it is a curiosity. Imagine such complicated titles as these:
“Minister’s second cook’s girl, Ume, age 2;” “Minister’s servant’s
cousin’s boy, age 11;” “Student’s interpreter’s teacher’s girl;”
“Vice-Consul’s jinrikisha-man’s boy.” And so it went on, till
there were fifty-eight of them of all ages, from one up to nineteen.
Some of them, indeed, were less than a year old; and I
was amused on the evening of the 2d at having the list brought
back to me with this note (Ogita’s English is still highly individual!)
“Marked X is declined to the invitation.” On looking
down the column, I found that ominous looking cross only
against one name, that of Yasu, daughter of Ito Kanejiro, Mr.
G——’s cook. This recalcitrant little person turned out to be
six weeks old—an early age for parties even nowadays. Miss
Yasu, having been born in November, was put down in the
following January as two years old, after the puzzling Japanese
fashion. Then I found that they would write boys as girls,
girls as boys, grown-ups as babies, and so on. Even at the last
moment a doll had to be turned into a sword, a toy tea-set into
a work-box, a history of Europe into a rattle; but people who
grow Christmas trees are prepared for such small contingencies,
and no one knew anything about it when on Friday afternoon
the great tree slowly glowed into a pyramid of light, and a long
procession of little Japs was marshalled in, with great solemnity
and many bows, till they stood, a delighted, wide-eyed crowd,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>round the beautiful shining thing, the first Christmas tree any
of them had ever seen. It was worth all the trouble to see the
gasp of surprise and delight, the evident fear that the whole
thing might be unreal and suddenly fade away. One little man
of two fell flat on his back with amazement, tried to rise and
have another look, and in so doing rolled over on his nose,
where he lay quite silent till his relatives rescued him. Behind
the children stood the mothers, quite as pleased as they,
and with them one very old lady with a little child on her back.</p>

<br>

<p>The children stood, the little ones in front and the taller
ones behind, in a semicircle, and the many lights showed
their bright faces and gorgeous costumes, for no one would
be outdone by another in smartness—I fancy the poorer
women had borrowed from richer neighbors—and the result
was picturesque in the extreme. The older girls had
their heads beautifully dressed, with flowers and pins and
rolls of scarlet crape knotted in between the coils; their
dresses were pale green or blue, with bright linings and stiff
silk obis; but the little ones were a blaze of scarlet, green,
geranium pink, and orange, their long sleeves sweeping the
ground, and the huge flower patterns on their garments
making them look like live flowers as they moved about on
the dark velvet carpet. When they had gazed their fill, they
were called up to me one by one, Ogita addressing them all
as “San” (Miss or Mr.), even if they could only toddle, and
I gave them their serious presents with their names, written
in Japanese and English, tied on with red ribbon—an
attention which, as I was afterwards told, they appreciated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
greatly. It seemed to me that they never would end; their
size varied from a wee mite who could not carry its own
toys to a tall, handsome student of sixteen, or a gorgeous
young lady in green and mauve crape, and a head that
must have taken the best part of the day to dress.</p>

<p>In one thing they were all alike; their manners were
perfect. There was no pushing or grasping, no glances of
envy at what other children received, no false shyness in
their sweet, happy way of expressing their thanks. I was
puzzled by one thing about the children: although we kept
giving them sweets and oranges off the tree, every time I
looked around the big circle all were empty-handed again,
and it really seemed as if they must have swallowed the
gifts, gold paper and ribbon and all. But at last I noticed
that their square, hanging sleeves began to have a strange,
lumpy appearance, like a conjurers waistcoat just before he
produces twenty-four bowls of live goldfish from his internal
economy; and then I understood that the plunder was at
once dropped into these great sleeves, so as to leave hands
free for anything else that Okusama might think good to
bestow. One little lady, O’Haru San, aged three, got so
overloaded with goodies and toys that they kept rolling out
of her sleeves, to the great delight of the Brown Ambassador
dachshund, Tip, who pounced on them like lightning,
and was also convicted of nibbling at cakes on the lower
branches of the tree.</p>

<p>The bigger children would not take second editions of
presents, and answered, “Honorable thanks, I have!” if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
offered more than they thought their share; but babies are
babies all the world over! When the distribution was finished
at last, I got a Japanese gentleman to tell them the
story of Christmas, the children’s feast; and then they came
up one by one to say “<em>Sayonara</em>” (“Since it must be,” the
Japanese farewell), and “<em>Arigato gozaimasu</em>” (“The honorable
thanks”).</p>

<p>“Come back next year,” I said; and then the last presents
were given out—beautiful lanterns, red, lighted, and
hung on what Ogita calls bumboos, to light the guests
home with. One tiny maiden refused to go, and flung
herself on the floor in a passion of weeping, saying that
Okusama’s house was too beautiful to leave, and she would
stay with me always—yes, she would! Only the sight of the
lighted lantern, bobbing on a stick twice as long as herself,
persuaded her to return to her own home in the servants’
quarters. I stood on the step, the same step where I had set
the fireflies free one warm night last summer, and watched
the little people scatter over the lawns, and disappear into the
dark shrubberies, their round, red lights dancing and shifting
as they went, just as if my fireflies had come back, on red
wings this time, to light my little friends to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Where_the_Christmas_Toys_Come_From">Where the Christmas Toys Come From</h2>
</div>

<p>Almost all the wooden toys come from Germany, where
peasants in the mountains of the Tyrol and Bavaria still
make them by hand. A herd-boy on the hillside will see
that his cattle are safely feeding in a narrow valley which
they cannot leave without passing him, and then he will sit
on the grass or on a rock and whittle and whistle or jodel
as the soft wood shapes itself in his fingers, through a long
summer day. And during the winter, while the snow lies
deep on the mountain paths, entire families give their time
to making Noah’s arks, toy villages with stiff little green
trees, toy furniture, carved figures of all kinds. Anything
which a man’s knife can make from poplar or plane wood
is carved during the long weeks when outdoor work is
impossible. At one time whole German villages used to
work in their own homes on cheap wooden toys of all
kinds. Nowadays, since the invention of the machines by
which the simpler forms are made, most of the toy trades
have been swept into the factories of German cities.</p>

<p>Toy reins, such as you see with tinkling sleigh-bells on
them, may be woven elsewhere in New England, but it is
fairly certain that the bells at least were made in Connecticut,
where the industry is a very old one, and where most
of the sleigh-bells in the country have been made, as well
as cow-bells and the tiny tinkler on the tea-table. And, naturally,
the state in which are so many clock factories produces
those toys which are made to go by a winding key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of tin trumpets, and other toy
musical instruments which used to be made in France and
Germany, are now made in this country, mainly in Pennsylvania
and New York. It is fascinating to watch the making
of them by machinery. Pull a handle here! Click!
down comes a frame and a long sheet of metal is cut into
pieces of the exact shape wanted. See! the frame on which
the metal rested is a moving belt bringing a fresh sheet of
metal under the stamps and at the same time carrying the
cut pieces forward over a row of steel cones where a set of
clamps like steel jaws catches each separate bit. The
clamps close once, nip! open, and each cone pushes forward
with a jerk into another which with one motion adds a
mouthpiece. What passes on now is a bent tube which
needs only a touch of solder to keep it closed, a few rings
of paint to make it gay, and perhaps a curved handle, to be
a very presentable toy trumpet.</p>

<p>Drums are almost all made in Massachusetts; marbles,
the best of them, come from Saxony; the old-fashioned
kinds of music-boxes, some of them very elaborate and
beautiful, still come from Switzerland. Glass ornaments
for Christmas trees are made in Germany; many of the
tinsel and cut-paper ornaments also come from Nüremburg
and other German cities which are the great toy markets of
the world. In one French village near Paris almost all the
bone dominoes have been made for years; another section
of France turns out nearly all the bone chessmen—such
figures as Alice found in the Looking-Glass country; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
a quantity of the furry rabbits, silky-haired dogs, and woolly
lambs on green-painted bellows which bleat <em>ba-a-a</em>, have been
made by one Parisian family for many years. The old
proprietor, his sons and daughters and even grandchildren,
have lived and worked together at the very top of an old
house in one of the side streets of the city, from a time
beyond the memory of all but few.</p>

<p>As for dolls—the making of a Christmas doll—that is
another story.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Making_of_a_Christmas_Doll">The Making of a Christmas Doll</h2>
</div>


<p>Does it seem to you that it would be a delightful
business to make hundreds of thousands of dolls every year?
H’m! Does this huge kettle of bad-smelling mush make
you think of the dainty, smiling dolls in the toy-shop window?
Dolly is made, though you would never guess it,
of chopped up bits of old kid gloves and pieces of cardboard
boiled to a pulp in a gum made from the horns
of goats. And here is a man shovelling sawdust into a
kettle half full of boiling water. Now he is turning the
mass into a big mixing trough, adding one shovelful after
another of the gluey mush. The machinery creaks and
turns and cuts and slaps as this mixture is kneaded into
a composition pulp. Now he is carrying some of it in a
hod, for all the world like sticky mortar, to a weighing
table! Sweep! it is spread out in an even thickness. Clip!
down come the knives which part it into the right quantities,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>and it is swiftly pressed and moulded to the shape
of a body, an arm, or a leg. In one factory alone the
parts of as many as forty thousand dolls are thus made
in one day, and the ugly, greenish shapes set aside to
harden. Another day they pass quickly under the brushes
in the painters’ hands after which they have the more familiar
rosy pink color, and dolly can now be put together except
for the head.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Of these dolls the heads are to be of porcelain. Once
for all, long ago, some artist made the model of which
many duplicate moulds stand ready. Into these moulds
liquid porcelain clay is poured; before it hardens the
openings for the eyes are cut and tiny holes made by
which it can be joined to a body. After the moulds are
opened, as the rows and rows of little heads stand in metal
trays, a painter comes by, covers them with a glaze-wash,
tints the cheeks and outlines the brows and lashes. Now
into the oven goes the tray for hours of slow baking.
But even with the head sewed on we have but a sad-looking
dolly, both blind and bald.</p>

<p>If all goes well, the eyes and the wig come next. The
eyes are not made in this factory at all. They come from
Germany, and it would probably give you a queer, scared
feeling to see the making of them. Look into this long,
dark room, and when your eyes are a little used to the
strange shadowiness, you will see that down its sides there
are rows of tables, before each of which sits a woman
with a blue-flame gas lamp in front of her. At little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
distances are retorts of glowing molten glass, and each
woman dips her short glass tube into the melted glass,
and, keeping it soft by the help of that weird blue flame of
the blowpipe jet, blows a little oblong globe which she
colors white for the eyeball, and then upon it paints a
pupil of blue, brown, or black, as the doll-makers may
have ordered. The musical click which you hear all the
time is the sharp stroke which breaks the finished and
cooled eye from the glass rod, letting it drop into a box
lined with cotton by her side. This boy coming out has
been collecting them, and it makes us shiver to see those
hundreds of eyes rolling uncannily at us from the bottom
of his basket. Come away!</p>

<p>A wig for an inexpensive doll is an easy matter; the
chosen strands of hair are laid along a double thread, which
passes below one strand and above the next. This thread
makes the “part,” and under it is stuck a bit of pasteboard
by which the wig is fastened on. A quick-fingered
French woman can turn out over a hundred dozen such
wigs in a day. And with the wig dolly is made at last.</p>

<p>Her clothes, of course, are a separate matter, just as
yours are; there are dolls’ shoemakers, and dolls’ dressmakers,
and the elaborate completeness of dolly’s outfit
depends only upon the price one is willing to pay.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Irinas_Day_on_the_Estates">Irina’s Day on the Estates</h2>
</div>


<p>Irina is a Russian who answers promptly if you ask
her what Christmas she remembers best, “The one we
spent on the estates.” But that may be because it was
so unusual to be there at all in the winter. Christmas
Eve is the great time in Russia, but Santa Claus does
not come until evening and the day before Christmas
being a fast-day is usually somewhat depressing.</p>

<p>Old Mashinka, who comes in to open the heavy, outer
shutters, usually has some lively gossip to tell while she
lets in the light. Perhaps wolves slipped into the courtyard
in the night and were fighting with the watch-dogs;
perhaps the snow has fallen again and is so deep that Ivan
and the stablemen have been out since daybreak cutting
new paths to the kitchens, stables, and farm buildings, and
breaking out the roads. Or perhaps Dmitri, who moved
yesterday into a new house, took with him a cock and
hen, and this morning the cock refused to crow at dawn
so that all the family are sure that evil fortune will enter
the house with the new year. But on this morning she
has no news to tell; she moves silently and slowly, for it
is a fast-day.</p>

<p>Even Irina, who is always ready to run and jump,
feels oppressed by the still, silent house. The dining
room is desolate with its breakfastless table, usually so
cosy with its steaming samovar. As a rule they are at
this time in St. Petersburg where, though Irina stays quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
all day in an upper room, except when attending church
services, she can at least look out upon all the coming and
going on the river and the Nevski Prospect. But this year
Andrei the steward is raising questions about the plans
and locations for new stables and barns, so they are here
where everything is depressingly still and silent, and upstairs
her father and mother are praying in their rooms.
So she puts on fur-lined boots, a long fur coat with deep
collar, and a fur cap which comes well down over the forehead,
and once outside the house finds herself in the thick
forest. Further on she comes to a frozen river, and fast-days
and solemn services are all forgotten, for there are
her two fur-wrapped brothers busy with a little sledge.
The red scarves of the boys are taken for guiding reins,
and far along the ice for two hours or more she drives
her team. They have passed beyond the forest and out
upon the steppes, where for miles ahead no trees are to be
seen except where willows mark the curve of the river, or
a few stunted saplings show black against the snow. On
one side is a long, low sheepfold belonging to Irina’s father,
and out comes the shepherd with a clamor of dogs. He
has no chairs, so he throws down three heaps of clean straw
for the children to sit on; and he, too, forgets that it is a
fast-day as he reaches cakes of dark brown bread from a
shelf below the tiny square window, and pours for them
cups of goats’ milk. Black crust and all—it goes quickly,
and then they rest and stroke the half-tamed sheep that
come to nibble the straw while the shepherd tells the children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>stories. He cannot read, to be sure, but when he was a
boy his old grandmother told them to him. Perhaps,
because it is the Christmas season, he tells them of
the old woman whom the Russians call Babouscka and
the Italians Befana. Irina’s favorite is one that would
remind you of Cinderella, although the fairy godmother
is much more like an old witch; and as the children start
off for home they wonder a little fearfully if this forest
is not very like the one in the shepherd’s story.</p>

<p>On arriving home they confess their sins—only the
little matter of the rye bread is really forgotten. Everybody
is busy; the cook is getting the supper, and father
in the drawing-room has the door locked. Some one has
said there will be no Christmas tree, for there are no shops
here; but why was mother away for four days, and why
did that pedler who came by a few days ago stay so long?
Irina finds a book, curls up on a rug, and tries to read,
but she does not understand Kryloff’s “Fables” very well;
the day out-doors has made her drowsy and she does not
quite know what becomes of the time until her brothers
shake her a little, the clock rings out “Cuckoo” six times,
and then open comes the door. There <em>is</em> a Christmas tree
after all, a tall one with a shining star at the top. Hundreds
of burning candles light it up, and tiny wax figures
dance among hanging oranges. At the foot of the tree
lie four or five heaps of parcels,—ah, then, mother <em>was</em>
shopping; no one is forgotten and every one is merry.
Then comes Pavel to say that supper is ready. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
white cloth looks very different from usual; it is not laid
smoothly at all. Underneath it has been spread a layer
of hay, and each one as he sits down pulls out a straw.
Irina gives a cry of joy: her piece is quite complete, with
its yellow, dried flower—which shows that she will be
lucky all the next year.</p>

<p>There is no meat at this Christmas Eve supper, only fish
dishes and the special <em>Kostya</em>, or puddings which belong to
the season very much as do mince pie and plum pudding in
England. Of these puddings there are two kinds,—the white
<em>Kostya</em>, made of rice, almonds, and raisins, and the black <em>Kostya</em>,
made of honey, barley, and walnuts.</p>

<p>During supper the children from the village school which
Irina’s mother has started come and sing carols outside the
window until Pavel with a handful of coins tells them to be off.
Other young villagers follow to acknowledge their gifts with
more singing. Lastly comes the church choir, who are invited
in to supper after Irina and her brothers have returned to the
tree and their new toys. For each there is a gift and from
each a torrent of good wishes.</p>

<p>This practice of carol singing is probably in its origin akin
to the religious processions which one may see on any holy
day in all the villages of Greece, the Balkan provinces, and up
through Russia,—wherever, in fact, the Greek church has diverted
into the service of religion the old customs of the people.
For centuries back and probably long before the Christian
era, it was the practice of the young people here and elsewhere
to gather into bands and go about the country roads at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
time of year singing hymns which were at first, no doubt, songs
of rejoicing that the shortest days were over and the sun returning
to the world again. Nowadays the songs are chants
or carols, and the village boys are proud to carry in religious
processions pictures of the saints and the banners of the church.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Cratchits_Christmas_Dinner">The Cratchits’ Christmas Dinner</h2>
</div>


<p>You might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds;
a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter
of course; and in truth, it was something like it in that house.
Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little
saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with
incredible vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce;
Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside
him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits
set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting
guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths,
lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be
helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said.
It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit,
looking slowly all along the carving knife, prepared to plunge
it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long-expected
gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all
around the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his
knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!</p>

<p>There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe
there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and
flavor, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration.
Eked out by the apple sauce and mashed potatoes, it
was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs.
Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom
of a bone on the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet
every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in
particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows!
But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs.
Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to
take the pudding up and bring it in.</p>

<p>Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should
break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got
over the wall of the back yard, and stolen it, while they were
merry with the goose; a supposition at which the two young
Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.</p>

<p>Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out
of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the
cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastry cook’s next
door to each other, with a laundress next door to that! That
was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered,
flushed, but smiling proudly, with the pudding like a speckled
cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern
of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into
the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly,
too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by
Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that
now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had
had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had
something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was
at all a small pudding for so large a family. It would have
been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed
to hint at such a thing. At last the dinner was all done,
the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up.
The compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect,
apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovelful
of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew
round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning
half a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family
display of glass—two tumblers and a custard-cup without a
handle.</p>

<p>These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well
as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out
with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered
and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:</p>

<p>“A merry Christmas to all, my dears. God bless us!”</p>

<p>Which all the family reëchoed.</p>

<p>“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim the last of all.</p>

</div>

<p>When dinner had had time to settle and all the kitchen
work was done, Father took his seat at the end of the long
table, with all the household gathered about, the servants included
and the baby without fail, and read the story of The
Child: “And it came to pass in those days,” while Mother
hushed the baby. Then we sang together “A Child is Born
in Bethlehem,” which was the simplest of our hymns, and
also the one we children loved best, for it told of how in
heaven we were to walk to church</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
“On sky-blue carpets, star-bedeckt,”<br>
</p>

<p class="no-indent">which was a great comfort. Children love beautiful things,
and we had few of them. The great and precious treasure in
our house was the rag carpet in the spare room, which we were
allowed to enter only on festive occasions such as Christmas.
It had an orange streak in it which I can see to this day.
Whenever I come across one that even remotely suggests it,
it gives me yet a kind of solemn feeling. We had no piano,—that
was a luxury in those days,—and Father was not a
singer, but he led on bravely with his tremulous bass and we
all joined in, Ane the cook and Maria the housemaid furtively
wiping their eyes with their aprons, for they were good and
pious folk and this was their Christmas service. So we sang
the ten verses to end, with their refrain “Hallelujah! hallelujah!”
that always seemed to me to open the very gates of
Yule.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“WE JOINED HANDS AND DANCED AROUND THE TREE”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>And it did, literally; for when the last hallelujah died away,
the door of the spare room was flung wide and there stood the
Christmas tree, all shining lights, and the baby was borne in,
wide-eyed, to be the first, as was proper; for was not this The
Child’s holiday? Unconsciously we all gave way to those who
were nearest Him, who had most recently come from His presence,
and were therefore in closest touch with the spirit of the
holiday. So, when we joined hands and danced around the
tree, Father held the baby, and we laughed and were happy
as the little one crowed his joy and stretched the tiny arms
toward the light.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_German_Christmas">A German Christmas</h2>
</div>


<p>In Germany a little girl begins to think about Christmas
almost as soon as she gets back from a summer holiday, for it
is still very much the custom there to make something yourself
for those you love best, and German girls learn while they
are still little to embroider beautifully all kinds of articles for
household use,—a monogram on a fine handkerchief, or spray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
of flowers on a bit of linen to wear at the neck. An older girl
makes such things as a canvas traveller’s-case, or a set of shoe-bags,
embroiders a sofa-cushion or knits a silk necktie.
Mothers and aunts are more likely to make soberly useful gifts
of stockings, underclothing, dresses; nothing is thought out-of-place.
But every one must give to every one else. That is <em>law</em>.
And every one aims to keep as a secret what she is making; it
must be hidden at least from the one for whom it is intended,
so there is quite an air of “I know something nice, but I cannot
tell it,” about a German household through all the weeks
before the holiday.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before Christmas the fair begins which
Mrs. Sidgwick tells us is to be seen “in any one of the old German
cities in the hill country, when the streets and the open
places are covered with crisp clean snow, and the mountains are
white with it, and the moon shines on the ancient houses, and
the tinkle of sledge bells reaches you when you escape from
the din of the market, and look down at the bustle of it from
some silent place, a high window, perhaps, or the high empty steps
leading into the cathedral. The air is cold and still, and heavy
with the scent of the Christmas trees brought from the forest
for the pleasure of the children. Day by day you see the rows
of them growing thinner, and if you go to the market on Christmas
Eve itself you will find only a few trees left out in the
cold. The market is empty, the peasants are harnessing their
horses or their oxen, the women are packing up their unsold
goods. In every home in the city one of the trees that scented
the open air about a week ago is shining now with lights and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
little gilded nuts and apples, and is helping to make that Christmas
smell, all compact of the pine forest, wax candles, cakes,
and painted toys, you must associate so long as you live with
Christmas in Germany.”</p>

<p>We have Christmas trees in plenty, but to the German
mind we have them all wrong. In the first place, their trees are
small, and every one, from the Emperor down to the poorest laborer,
has a tree. But he has it at home, on Christmas Eve if
he can, less often on Christmas Day, and only sometimes on the
day after, which they call the Second Christmas Day. A German
family never invites a <em>party</em> to its Christmas tree, only
relatives or intimate friends. As a rule, there is one tree, fixed
on a small stand in the centre of a large square table covered
with a snow-white cloth, and around the tree the presents are
arranged, those for each person in a separate pile. The tree is
lighted for beauty, and is decorated with ornaments of glass
and tinsel, sweetmeats, apples, gilded nuts, and a few very
small toys. Some of the sweetmeats made for German trees
are very elaborate. There are <em>Kringeln</em>, transparent sugar
candies twisted in figure eights or circles, so that they easily
hang on. There are sugar candy animals of every shape and color;
and here and there a fascinating scene in colored sugar on a
white background, a sportsman in a red coat, perhaps, pointing
his gun at an enormous rabbit that sits up almost touching the
end of the gun-barrel. The celebrated <em>Lübecker Marzipan</em> (a
kind of almond paste which you have tasted, maybe, on bride-cake)
imitates all kinds of fruit and vegetables so well that they
can easily be mistaken for real.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The trees are set in the front rooms and the curtains
are drawn up to give any passer-by a glimpse of their
beauty. The family gathers in the room behind, sometimes
a carol or hymn is sung, and at its end suddenly the parlor
doors fly back, showing the little green tree all alight and
the piles of presents for every one. Then comes a scramble
and search for one’s own pile,—a long silence while parcels
are opened breathlessly. Such a handshaking and embracing
and thanking as follows!</p>

<p>In some families where there are several children and
plenty of money, each person may have a tree of his own,
and at any rate will have his own table covered with presents
and things to eat. Of such a family the mother writes:—</p>

<p>Every time the three babies go into the garden they
expect to meet the Christ Child with His arms full of gifts.
They firmly believe that it is thus their presents are brought,
and it is such a charming idea that Christmas would be
worth celebrating for its sake alone.</p>

<p>The library is uninhabitable for several days before and
after, as it is there that we have the trees and presents.
All down one side are the trees, and the other three sides
are lined with tables, a separate one for each person
in the house. When trees are lighted, and stand in their
radiance shining down on the happy faces, I forget all the
trouble it has been, and the number of times I have had
to run up and down stairs, and the various aches in head
and feet, and enjoy myself as much as anybody. First the
June baby is ushered in, then the others and ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
according to age, then the servants, then come the head
inspector and his family, and other inspectors from the different
farms, the mamsells, the bookkeepers and secretaries, and then
all the children, troops and troops of them—the big ones
leading the little ones by the hand and carrying the babies
in their arms, and the mothers peeping round the door. As
many as can get in stand in front of the trees, and sing two or
three carols; then they are given their presents, and go off
triumphantly, making room for the next batch. My three
babies sung lustily, too, whether they happened to know what
was being sung or not....</p>

<p>When they came to say good night they were all very pale
and subdued. The April baby had an exhausted-looking
Japanese doll with her, which she said she was taking to bed,
not because she liked him, but she was so sorry for him, he
seemed so very tired. They kissed me absently, and went
away, only the April baby glancing at the trees as she passed
and making them a courtesy.</p>

<p>“Good-by, trees,” I heard her say; and then she made the
Japanese doll bow to them, which he did, in a very languid and
blase fashion. “You’ll never see such trees again,” she told
him, giving him a vindictive shake, “for you’ll be brokened long
before next time.”</p>

<p>She went out, but came back as though she had forgotten
something.</p>

<p>“Thank the Christkind so much, Mummy, won’t you, for

<h2 class="nobreak" id="An_English_Adoration">An English “Adoration”</h2>
</div>

<p>Art in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was far more
closely connected with the church than it is to-day. The most
beautiful buildings were those of the church, and the art of
painting was soon called upon for their decoration. Books at
that time were rare and costly, and the stories of the saints
whose “holydays” were times of festivity for the people, were
mostly handed down by word of mouth, and often with
a good deal of confusion of times and people. And naturally,
when the rich men of 1300 called in a workman to
decorate a church or to paint a panel which could be moved
from one building to another, they liked to see on their
walls pictures of their favorite saints and heroes, pictures
which reminded them of the stories they could not read. It
made no difference to them if saint and hero and king lived
hundreds of years apart.</p>

<p>There is one such picture, one of the oldest in England,
so old that no one knows who painted it, which is
interesting because it is so easy to see that the king who
ordered it painted was thinking of the old Christmas story
of the Adoration of the Magi, who were always thought
of in the Middle Ages as being kings. The picture is
painted on two wooden panels, joined with hinges so that
it can be closed, and is in bright colors against a background
of gold.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The English king who probably ordered it to celebrate
his coronation was Richard II. of England, son of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>famous Black Prince. One likes to think that although he
thought of himself as one of a long line of kings ruling
by divine right, whom it was natural to see surrounded by
persons royal and divine, yet he wished to be painted not
in the act of receiving but of giving homage. After all, in
spite of the king’s crown and the robe of state, too big for a
child’s figure, he was only a boy barely eleven, and whatever
he became later here he is shown offering his kingdom to the
Holy Child in His Mother’s arms.</p>

<p>There was a special reason for Richard’s having his picture
resemble pictures of the Adoration of the Magi for the
Day of the Kings, January 6, was not only his own birthday,
but also the day upon which he was crowned. And an
account of his coronation tells us that after the ceremony he
made an offering at the Shrine of Our Lady at Pewe, nearby,
of “eleven angels,” one for each year of his young life. Exactly
what these eleven angels were no one now knows;
they may have been gold coins with an angel stamped upon
them, or they may have been small images. But perhaps he
remembered his eleven years and this offering when he told
the painter to surround Mother Mary with the eleven angels
in sapphire blue whom you see in the picture. One
sees at least that they are <em>his</em> angels, for each wears his
special badge, the Jewel of the White Hart, and the Collar
of Broom-pods. Almost all the Magi pictures represent one
of the kings as kneeling, with the two others standing behind
him, and one can imagine Richard boyishly choosing
the other two kings. He was crowned in Westminster Abbey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
so it is natural enough that one of them should be
Edward the Confessor who founded the Abbey; the other,
holding an arrow, is St. Edmund, an early king of England
who is said to have been shot to death with arrows by the
Danes, because he refused to abandon Christianity. Joseph,
too, is a customary figure in paintings of the Adoration, but
cannot you hear the boy king saying, “No, I do not want
St. Joseph; my father died in midsummer so I really became
king about the time of St. John’s Day, if I <em>am</em>
crowned at Epiphany; so I will have St. John with a
lamb and Edward the Confessor; and Edward shall hold a
ring?” There is a pretty story that St. John the Evangelist,
wandering in the disguise of a beggar, asked alms of King
Edward the Confessor; and, that the king, rather than refuse
a poor man, gave him a ring from his finger, because he
had no money with him. And it would be so like a boy
not to care that the two St. Johns were not at all the same.
That which mattered is that one of the angels was holding
toward the Holy Child’s reaching hands the banner of England
as the gift of the kneeling boy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Childrens_Own_Saint">The Children’s Own Saint</h2>
</div>

<p>What a most convenient thing it is that good St. Nicholas
does not have to keep the Christmas holiday in all the world
at once! He has been the children’s own saint, you know,
ever since he ceased to be a bishop in far-away Asia Minor.
The oldest story we hear of him is that once three little boys
on their way to school at Athens stopped over night at an
inn, of which the innkeeper was also a butcher, and a robber
besides. This wicked man killed the boys in the night and
threw their bodies into his salting tub. But the very next
morning the saint walked in and asked for them, for though he
was only Bishop Nicholas then, he knew all about it in some
wonderful way. The trembling butcher took him out to the
pork barrel; the saint struck the edge of it sharply with his
staff and called the boys by name. Out jumped the three little
pickles all alive, and of course the wicked butcher was punished
and Nicholas became the school-boys’ saint.</p>

<p>There is also a story that one night Bishop Nicholas wished
to carry a purse of gold to a worthy nobleman who was so
proud and so unwilling to have his poverty noticed that it was
a difficult matter to make the gift without hurting his feelings.
When the house was reached the old noble was to be seen
through the window fast asleep by the fire, and without disturbing
him good St. Nicholas climbed to the top of the wide chimney
and dropped the purse, intending it to fall on the hearth.
But as the old man’s daughter had hung her father’s stockings
by the fire to dry, it chanced to fall into one of them. There it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
was found the next day and most opportunely provided a
marriage portion for the oldest daughter. The story goes on
to say that after that whenever one of the noble’s daughters
was of marrying age he hung up a stocking,—and St. Nicholas’s
gift was never lacking.</p>

<p>They say that all this happened early in December, and in
some countries December 6 is the great day for the children.
In Holland, on St. Nicholas Eve, December 5, the children go
out with their parents to see the brilliantly decorated shops,
and in the doorways of many of them stands the saint, gorgeously
dressed and handing to every child who passes a tiny
toy or a sweet. No wonder the good saint must needs go to
the seashore for a day before his next heavy job of being
Santa Claus to all America on the twenty-fifth,—to say nothing
of merry England!</p>

<p>At any rate, we find that in a certain seaport of southern
Italy it is the sailors’ custom on December 6 to take the image
of the saint from the beautiful church of St. Nicholas
and, with a long procession of boats, carry it far out to sea.
Toward nightfall they return and in the glory of the gold and
crimson sunset are met on landing by all the townspeople.
Hundreds of quaintly dressed pilgrims from the country round
join the crowd that welcomes the home-coming saint with songs,
bonfires, and torches, and brings him back to his own place.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>His next appearance is in those countries where the Greek
Church is the national religion. Their Day of St. Nicholas,
which is December 6 elsewhere, comes upon what we should
call December 19, and the saint is supposed to bring the winter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>with him. On the frozen river by Peter’s city it is celebrated
with a skating and sleighing carnival. Lines of track
are laid down on the ice like small-sized street-car lines. Tiny
cars run here and there along them, back and forth from the
smooth ice-fields roped off for sleigh races or skating contests.
Perhaps it was in that cold country he found the high cap, the
furs, and the coat he wears for his hard work of chimney
scrambling and running the reindeer express on the Christmas
Eve we know.</p>

<p>Once more after his strenuous American holiday week is
over the hard-worked saint appears again. From the little
whitewashed villages of Greece north to ice-bound Archangel
and east even to Vladivostok the saint swings wearily on thousands
of wax-lighted Christmas trees (their Christmas Eve
comes, you must remember, thirteen days after ours). But
he is a sadly wasted saint by this time—a mere waxen image
a few inches long—able only to dance a little at the tip of a
branch of a Christmas tree, and that is all he is asked to do.
But in some houses you would find him with a queer cotton
tassel in the top of his cap, and what happens then is this:
some boy or girl comes by, touches his cotton tassel into flame
from a lighted taper, and he burns and melts and grows shorter
as if he were just an ordinary wax candle until he is all gone.</p>

<p>But in spite of that, in the next December, when the little
children in Holland beg their mothers to take them out to see
the lighted shops, there he is again with his bag of sweets.
And if you want to know what happens to him after that you
will only have to read this story over again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Befana_Fair_in_Rome">The Befana Fair in Rome</h2>
</div>


<p>In Rome the season of making gifts corresponding to our
Christmas comes twelve days later, and the gift-bringer would
not be called Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas, but Befana, a
gruff little old woman. Perhaps she is in some way connected
with the old woman of whom the legend is told that she was
sweeping out her house when the Three Kings rode by with
gifts for the infant Christ. “Come,” they said, “and see the
<em>Bambin Gesù</em>.” She said she would when she had finished
her sweeping. But though she took her gifts and started, she
was too late then, of course, so she gave the presents to good
children and bits of charcoal to those who had been naughty.
The name is really a short form of Epifania, the Feast of
Epiphany, and it is given both to the gift-bringer and to one
of the most extraordinary popular festivals ever invented to
amuse children and to turn grown people into children. It is
a night fair opened every Eve of Epiphany in the great square
called Piazza Navona, where long, long ago one of the Roman
emperors, Domitian, once had his race-course. In the days
just after Christmas workmen begin to bring out from queer
underground storerooms all the lumber and other material
needed for setting up booths and decorating the square for
the Befana. From year to year it lies somewhere, ready for
use at a moment’s notice, and when needed it is suddenly produced
without confusion, marked and numbered, all ready to
be put together and regilded, or repainted, or hung with acres
of bright-colored draperies. The Romans are masters of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
art of managing public displays and change the empty, windy
square as if by magic suddenly into a great oval street of
booths enclosing the whole circus-shaped space. At dark on
the Eve of the Epiphany the Befana begins. The hundreds
of booths are choked with toys, and gleam with thousands of
little lights. In the open spaces the moving crowd of children,
parents, and grandparents grows closer and closer between
sunset and midnight, and every one is splitting the air with
some sort of whistle, horn, or trumpet. Noise is the chief
need of a successful Befana, and the first thing every one buys
who comes must be a tin horn or one of the grotesque little
figures made of painted clay, always with a whistle in some
part of it. Their very ugliness is attractive, and they are
daubed with a kind of bright and harmless paint of which
every Roman child remembers the taste so long as he lives.
Round and round the crowd moves in a stream of young, old,
and middle-aged, all blowing horns and whistles with a ridiculously
solemn persistency, bent on making all the noise it is
possible to get out of one small toy. Now and then they stop
to buy at some booth, or to greet a friend; one group attacks
another with a specially strong burst of noise almost too much
to stand when shrill whistles are brought close to ears, and
there are shouts of laughter when the party which can make
the most hideous noise drives off the other half deaf from the
din.</p>

<p>In one long-remembered year, in the old English Protestant
church about a mile away, the organ was rebuilt and the
organist, a practical Anglo-Saxon, had the useless old pipes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
sold at the night fair for the benefit of the church. The braying
of the high cracked reeds was frightful and never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Thousands upon thousands of people throng the square;
even under the clear winter sky it is not cold; the flaring,
smoking, wind-blown torches throw strange shadows down
upon the old women who behind the booths sit warming their
skinny hands over earthen pots of glowing coals. They look
on without a smile on their wrinkled faces while their sons
and daughters sell little old women of clay, the very images
of their mothers, to passing customers. And there is no confusion,
no accident, no trouble, there are no drunken men and
no pickpockets. But Romans are not like other people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Babouscka">Babouscka</h2>
</div>


<p>It was the night the dear Christ Child came to Bethlehem.
In a country far away from Him, an old, old woman
named Babouscka sat in her snug little house by her warm
fire. The wind was drifting the snow outside and howling
down the chimney, but it only made Babouscka’s fire burn
more brightly.</p>

<p>“How glad I am that I may stay indoors!” said Babouscka,
holding her hands out to the bright blaze.</p>

<p>But suddenly she heard a loud rap at her door. She
opened it, and her candle shone on three old men standing
outside in the snow. Their beards were as white as the snow,
and so long that they reached the ground. Their eyes shone
kindly in the light of Babouscka’s candle, and their arms were
full of precious things—boxes of jewels, and sweet-smelling
oils, and ointments.</p>

<p>“We have travelled far, Babouscka,” they said, “and we stop
to tell you of the Baby Prince born this night in Bethlehem.
He comes to rule the world and teach all men to be loving and
true. We carry Him gifts. Come with us, Babouscka!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>But Babouscka looked at the driving snow, and then inside
at her cozy room and the crackling fire. “It is too late for me
to go with you, good sirs,” she said, “the weather is too cold.”
She went inside again and shut the door, and the old men
journeyed on to Bethlehem without her. But as Babouscka
sat by her fire, rocking, she began to think about the little
Christ Child, for she loved all babies.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I will go to find Him,” she said; “to-morrow,
when it is light, and I will carry Him some toys.”</p>

<p>So when it was morning Babouscka put on her long cloak,
and took her staff, and filled her basket with the pretty things
a baby would like, gold balls, and wooden toys, and strings of
silver cobwebs—and she set out to find the Christ Child.</p>

<p>But, oh! Babouscka had forgotten to ask the three old
men the road to Bethlehem, and they had travelled so far
through the night that she could not overtake them. Up and
down the roads she hurried, through woods and fields and
towns, saying to whomsoever she met: “I go to find the
Christ Child. Where does He lie? I bring some pretty toys
for His sake.”</p>

<p>But no one could tell her the way to go, and they all said,
“Farther on, Babouscka, farther on.” So she travelled on, and
on, and on for years and years—but she never found the little
Christ Child.</p>

<p>They say that old Babouscka is travelling still, looking for
Him. When it comes Christmas Eve, and the children are
lying fast asleep, Babouscka comes softly through the snowy
fields and towns, wrapped in her long cloak and carrying her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
basket on her arm. With her staff she raps gently at the
doors and goes inside and holds her candle close to the little
children’s faces.</p>

<p>“Is He here?” she asks. “Is the little Christ Child here?”
And then she turns sorrowfully away again, crying, “Farther
on, farther on.” But before she leaves she takes a toy from
her basket and lays it beside the pillow for a Christmas gift.
“For His sake,” she says softly and then hurries on through
the years and forever in search of the little Christ Child.</p>

<p>If you had been a child in Provence when Mistral was a
boy, you might perhaps have joined the excited party of curly-headed
boys and fair-haired girls in hoods and clacking wooden
shoes who went with him to meet the Three Kings, the Wise
Men from the East, coming to worship the Holy Child on the
night before Epiphany. Mistral told of it long afterwards in
this way:—</p>

<p>With hearts beating and eyes bright we started forth on
the road to Arles, bearing our gifts of welcome, cakes for the
Kings, figs for the boy pages, sweet hay for the tired camels.
The wind blew cold, the robin and wren hopped shivering in
the branches of the leafless trees. The fields were empty
except for perhaps an old woman picking up sticks, or a ragged
snail-gatherer under the hedge.</p>

<p>“Where are you going so late, my little ones?” some one
would ask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“We go to meet the Kings,” we said, singing and laughing,
sliding and running along the white, wind-swept road. But
the daylight faded, the black, pointed cypress trees hid the bell-tower
of Maillane, and the long, white road stretched away
empty.... Then we met a shepherd, his long, brown cloak
held tight around him.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the Kings? Are they still a long way off?”</p>

<p>“Ah! the Kings! You should see them soon. They are
not so far away.”</p>

<p>Then we set off running again, with our gifts for the Kings
and the pages, and handfuls of hay for the camels. The bravest
of us flagged a little as a great cloud over the mountain
hid the sun, when suddenly a flash of golden splendor and
a glory of yellow and crimson shone just where the white road
curved from behind the mountain.</p>

<p>“The Kings! The Kings! See their mantles! See the
banners! They are coming.”</p>

<p>And so we stood amazed; but instead of growing brighter
as if the Kings were coming nearer, the glory faded with the
sunset and we found ourselves alone in the dark highway.</p>

<p>“Which way did the Kings go?”</p>

<p>“They have gone behind the mountain.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The white owls hooted, the wind was chill, and night-shadows
frightened us; so close together with backward
glances we hurried toward the village again. The hay we
threw away, but the cakes we had brought to give the Kings
and the figs for the boy pages—they were comforting. And
at home our mothers asked us: “Well, did you see them?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>
<p>“Only a long way off. They went behind the mountain.”</p>

<p>“But what road did you take?”</p>

<p>“The road to Arles.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my poor lambs—but the Kings never come by that
road. They come from the East—you should have taken the
Roman road. Ah, the beautiful sight when they entered Maillane!
the banners and trumpets! the pages leading the camels!
But what a show! Now they are gone to the church to offer
their adoration. After supper you shall go and see them.”</p>

<p>Suppers were swallowed quickly, mine at my grandmother’s,
and then we all ran to the church. Sure enough, high above
the manger hung the glittering star, and on bended knees
before the Holy Child were the Three Kings—Gaspar, in a
crimson cloak, with gifts of gold; Melchior, in yellow, offering
incense; and Balthasar, in a mantle blue, presenting a vase of
myrrh. How reverently we admired the gayly dressed pages
who carried the Kings’ long trains, and the great camels whose
heads and humps rose high above St. Joseph’s ass and the
oxen!...</p>

<p>Many a time since those days I have been on the Arles
road at this season when the robin and wren haunt the hawthorne
hedges. The snail-gatherer still searches under the
hedge and the owls hoot in the winter evening. But I see no
more in the glory of the sunset clouds the banners of the
Kings.</p>

<p>“Which way did they go, the Kings?”</p>

<p>“Behind the mountain.”</p>

feast of Good-Will, does not come over everything each year,
even in a lonely cottage on an abandoned farm in Connecticut,
than which you cannot possibly imagine anything more silent
or more remote from the noise of the world. Sometimes it
rains in torrents just on that night, sometimes it blows a
raging gale that twists the leafless birches and elms and
hickory trees like dry grass and bends the dark firs and
spruces as if they were feathers, and you can hardly be heard
unless you shout, for the howling and screaming and whistling
of the blast.</p>

<p>But now and then, once in four or five years perhaps, the
feathery snow lies a foot deep, fresh-fallen, on the still country
side and in the woods; and the waxing moon sheds her large
light on all, and Nature holds her breath to wait for the happy
day and tries to sleep, but cannot from sheer happiness and
peace. Indoors, the fire is glowing on the wide hearth, a great
bed of coals that will last all night and be enough, because it is
not bitter weather, but only cold and clear and still, as it should
be; or if there is only a poor stove, the iron door is open and
a comfortable, cheery red light shines out from within upon the
battered iron plate and the wooden floor beyond; and the older
people sit around it, not saying much, and thinking with their
hearts rather than with their heads; but small boys and girls
know that interesting things have been happening in the
kitchen all the afternoon, and are rather glad that the supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
was not very good, because there will be more room for good
things to-morrow; and the grown-ups and the children have
made up any little differences of opinion they may have had
before supper time, because Good-Will must reign, and reign
alone, like Alexander; so that there is nothing at all to regret,
and nothing hurts anybody any more, and they are all happy
in just waiting for King Christmas to open the door softly and
make them all great people in his kingdom. But if it is the
right sort of house, he is already looking in through the window,
to be sure that every one is all ready for him, and that
nothing has been forgotten.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
